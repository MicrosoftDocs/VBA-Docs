# Create Custom Dialog Boxes

Use the following procedure to create a custom dialog box:


1. [Create a UserForm](create-userforms.md)
    
    On the **Insert** menu in the Visual Basic Editor, click **UserForm**.
    
2. [Add controls to UserForms](add-controls-to-userforms.md)
    
    Find the control you want to add in the **Toolbox** and drag the control onto the form.
    
3. [Set control properties](set-control-properties.md)
    
    Right-click a control in design mode and click **Properties** to display the **Properties** window.
    
4. [Initialize the controls](initialize-control-properties.md)
    
    You can initialize controls in a procedure before you show a form, or you can add code to the **Initialize** event of the form.
    
5. [Write event procedures](use-events-with-the-application-object.md)
    
    All controls have a predefined set of events. For example, a command button has a **Click** event that occurs when the user clicks the command button. You can write event procedures that run when the events occur.
    
6. [Display the custom dialog box](display-custom-dialog-boxes.md)
    
    Use the **Show** method to display a UserForm.
    
7. [Use control values while code is running](use-control-values-while-code-is-running.md)
    
    Some properties can be set at run time. Changes made to the dialog box by the user are lost when the dialog box is closed.
