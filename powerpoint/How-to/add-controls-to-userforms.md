# Add Controls to UserForms

To add controls to a user form, find the control you want to add in the **Toolbox**, drag the control onto the form, and then drag an adjustment handle on the control until the control's outline is the size and shape you want.

> [!NOTE] 
> Dragging a control (or a number of "grouped" controls) from the form back to the **Toolbox** creates a template of that control, which you can reuse. This is a useful feature for implementing a standard "look and feel" for your applications.

After you added controls to the form, use the commands on the **Format** menu in the Visual Basic Editor to adjust the control alignment and spacing.
