# Add Controls to Documents

To add controls to a document, display the **Control Toolbox**, click the control you want to add, and then click the document. Drag an adjustment handle of the control until the control's outline is the size and shape you want.

> [!NOTE] 
> Dragging a control (or a number of "grouped" controls) from the form back to the **Control Toolbox** creates a template of that control, which you can reuse. This is a useful feature for implementing a standard "look and feel" for your applications.
