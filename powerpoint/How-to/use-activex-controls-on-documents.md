# Use ActiveX Controls on Documents

Just as you can add ActiveX controls to custom dialog boxes, you can add controls directly to a document when you want to provide a sophisticated way for the user to interact directly with your macro without the distraction of dialog boxes. Use the following procedure to add ActiveX controls to your document. For more specific information about using ActiveX controls in PowerPoint, see [How to: Use ActiveX Controls on Slides](use-activex-controls-on-slides.md).


1. Add controls to documents
    
    Display the **Control Toolbox**, click the control you want to add, and then click the document.
    
2. Set control properties
    
    Right-click a control in design mode and click **Properties** to display the **Properties** window.
    
3. Initialize the control
    
    You can initialize controls in a procedure.
    
4. Control and dialog box events
    
    All controls have a predefined set of events. For example, a command button has a Click event that occurs when the user clicks the command button. You can write event procedures that run when the events occur.
    
5. Use control values while code is running
    
    Some properties can be set at run time.
