# Mark a position in a DAO Recordset

A bookmark is a system-generated Byte array that uniquely identifies each record. The DAO **[Bookmark](../../../api/overview/Access.md)** property of a **[Recordset](../../../api/overview/Access.md)** object changes each time you move to a new record. To identify a record, move to that record and then assign the value of the DAO **Bookmark** property to a variable of type Variant. To return to the record, set the DAO **Bookmark** property to the value of the variable.

The following code example shows how to find the product that makes the most and least revenue per category by using a bookmark to save the current record position. By using a bookmark, you can perform other operations on the **Recordset** object, and then return to the saved record position.

   If rstProducts.EOF Then Exit Sub

            "ORDER BY CategoryID"

   ' For each category find the product generating the least revenue 
   ' and the product generating the most revenue.

A bookmark is useful if a method fails because the current record position is undefined. The **[LastModified](../../../api/overview/Access.md)** property of the **Recordset** object provides a good illustration of how to use a bookmark. The **LastModified** property returns the bookmark of the last record in the **Recordset** to be added or modified. To use it, set the DAO **Bookmark** property equal to the **LastModified** property, as follows.

```vb
rstCustomers.Bookmark = rstCustomers.LastModified 

```

This moves the current record position to the last record that was added or modified. This is particularly useful when adding new records, because after you add a new record, the current record is the one you were on before you added the record. With the **LastModified** property, you can move to the newly added record if that is what your application expects.
When you close a **Recordset** object, any bookmarks you saved become invalid. 

You cannot use a bookmark from one **Recordset** in another **Recordset**, even if both **Recordset** objects are based on the same underlying table or query. However, you can use a bookmark on the clone of a **Recordset**, as shown in the following example.

```vb
Dim dbsNorthwind As DAO.Database 
Dim rstOriginal As DAO.Recordset 
Dim rstDuplicate As DAO.Recordset 
Dim varBookMark As Variant 
 
   Set dbsNorthwind = CurrentDb 
 
   ' Create the first Recordset. 
   Set rstOriginal = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Orders", dbOpenDynaset) 
 
   ' Save the current record position. 
   varBookMark = rstOriginal.Bookmark 
 
   ' Create a duplicate Recordset. 
   Set rstDuplicate = rstOriginal.Clone() 
 
   ' Go to the same record. 
   rstDuplicate.Bookmark = varBookMark 
 
   rstOriginal.Close 

```

You can also use the DAO **Bookmark** property on the **Recordset** object underlying a form. With this property, your code can mark which record is currently displayed on the form, and then change the record that is being displayed. For example, on a form containing employee information, you may want to include a button that a user can click to show the record for an employee's supervisor.

> [!NOTE] 
> Dynasets based on certain linked tables, such as Paradox tables that have no primary key, do not support bookmarks, nor do forward-only-type **Recordset** objects. You can determine whether a given **Recordset** object supports bookmarks by checking the value of the **[Bookmarkable](../../../api/overview/Access.md)** property.
