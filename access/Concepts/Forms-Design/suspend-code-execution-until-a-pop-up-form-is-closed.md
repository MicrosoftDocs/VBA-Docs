# Suspend code execution until a pop-up form is closed

To ensure that code in a form suspends operation until a pop-up form is closed, you must open the pop-up form as a modalwindow. The following example illustrates how to use the **[OpenForm](../../../api/Access.DoCmd.OpenForm.md)** method to do this.


```vb
doCmd.OpenForm FormName:=<Name of form to open>, WindowMode:=acDialog
```
