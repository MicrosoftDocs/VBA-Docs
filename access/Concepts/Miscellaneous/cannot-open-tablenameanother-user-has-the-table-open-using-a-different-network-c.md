# Cannot open <tablename>. Another user has the table open using a different network control file or locking style. (Error 3418)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The Microsoft Access database engine cannot open an external Paradox table because of inconsistencies between your initialization settings and those of another user who currently has the table open. The  **ParadoxNetPath** and the **ParadoxNetStyle** settings in the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\Paradox** key of the Microsoft Windows Registry must be consistent for all users sharing a database. Make sure your initialization settings match those of all other users sharing the database, and then try opening the table again.
