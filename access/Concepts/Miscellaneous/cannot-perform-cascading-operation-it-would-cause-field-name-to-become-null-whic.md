# Cannot perform cascading operation. It would cause field <name> to become Null, which is not allowed. (Error 3401)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The cascade operation you are attempting would result in a  **Null** value in the indicated field, which has been set up to not allow **Null** values. Check the values you are attempting to update and fix them so they do not result in **Null** values in this field.
