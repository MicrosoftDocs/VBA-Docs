# Between operator without And (Error 2430)

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

When using the **Between** operator to test whether a value of an expression lies within a specified range of values, specify the upper and lower limits of the range separated with the reserved word **And**. For example, to test for a range of A to C, you could use the following code:

```vb
WHERE fldName Between "A" And "C"

```
