# Format of memo file does not match specified external database format. (Error 3286)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Your application cannot read the memo file associated with the database you are trying to import or link and consequently cannot import or link the file. The memo file may be in the wrong format; for example, if you selected dBASE IV as the data source and the memo file is in a Microsoft FoxPro format.
