# Cannot perform cascading operation. There must be a related record in table <name>. (Error 3397)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The cascade operation you are attempting violates a referential integrity rule that requires a related record in the indicated table. Check the values you are attempting to update or delete, and fix them so they comply with the referential integrity rule.
