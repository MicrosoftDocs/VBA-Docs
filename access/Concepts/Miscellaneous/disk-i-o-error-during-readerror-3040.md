# Disk I/O error during read. (Error 3040)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The disk could not be read due to an internal disk or drive failure.

Possible causes:


- You tried to read from a network drive, and the network is temporarily busy, or you are no longer connected to the network. Check the network connection, and then try the operation again.
    
- The disk or drive has failed.
