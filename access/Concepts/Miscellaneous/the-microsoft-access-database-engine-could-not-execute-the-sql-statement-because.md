# The Microsoft Access database engine could not execute the SQL statement because it contains a field that has an invalid data type. (Error 3169)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to execute an SQL statement that contains a field that has an invalid field data type.

Possible causes:


- You included a Memo or OLE Object field in an expression where it is not allowed.
    
- You included a numeric aggregate function, such as  **Sum** or **StDev**, that tried to perform a calculation on a Text field. Choose a different aggregate function.
