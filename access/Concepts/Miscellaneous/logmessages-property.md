# LogMessages property

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You can use the **LogMessages** property in an SQL pass-through query to specify whether messages returned from an SQL database are stored in a messages table in the current Microsoft Access database.

> [!NOTE] 
> The **LogMessages** property applies only to pass-through queries.


## Setting

The **LogMessages** property uses the following settings.

|Setting|Visual Basic|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Yes|**True** (-1)|Microsoft Access stores messages returned from the SQL database in a messages table.|
|No|**False** (0)|(Default) Microsoft Access doesn't store messages returned from the SQL database.|

You can set this property by using the query's property sheet or Visual Basic.


## Remarks

The name of the messages table where the returned messages are stored is  _username - nn_, where _username_ is the logon name of the user running the pass-through query, and _nn_ is an integer that increases in increments of 1, starting at 00. For example, if user JoanW sets the **LogMessages** property to Yes and receives messages from an SQL database, the messages table will be named JoanW - 00. If JoanW receives messages in another Microsoft Access session (and the first table hasn't been deleted), a new table named JoanW - 01 is created.

> [!NOTE] 
> Error messages from SQL Server aren't stored in the messages table.
