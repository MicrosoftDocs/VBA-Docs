# Could not lock table <name>; currently in use by user <name> on machine <name>. (Error 3262)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to lock a table while opening it, but the table cannot be locked because it is currently in use. Wait a moment, and then try the operation again.
