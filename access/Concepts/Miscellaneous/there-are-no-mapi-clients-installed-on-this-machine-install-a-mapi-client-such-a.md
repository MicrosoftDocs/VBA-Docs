Microsoft Outlook/Exchange IISAM uses the Messaging API (MAPI) to obtain folder or address book information. To get MAPI onto your machine you must install one of the Microsoft email clients that uses MAPI, such as Outlook Client, Outlook Express, or Exchange Client. Until you do this, the Outlook/Exchange IISAM cannot work.
