# Field <name> is based on an expression and cannot be edited. (Error 3327)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

For example, if a stored query or view with a column made up of an expression was created, you would not be able to update that column. The following would return this error: CREATE VIEW VCustomer AS SELECT (FirstName & LastName) AS Test FROM Customer followed by UPDATE Test FROM VCustomer
