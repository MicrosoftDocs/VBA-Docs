# The Microsoft Access database engine sorting dlls could not be loaded properly. (Error 3757)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The Microsoft Access database engine uses two sorting DLLs for comparisons and indexing, ACEWSTR.DLL and ACEWDAT.DLL. Make sure that those DLLs are in the path used to load DLLs.
