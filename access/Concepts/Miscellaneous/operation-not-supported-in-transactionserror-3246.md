# Operation not supported in transactions. (Error 3246)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to perform an operation that is not valid within a transaction. A transaction can be one you create using a  **BeginTrans** statements, or an internal transaction created by the Microsoft Access database engine, such as when you delete multiple records in a single operation.
