# Could not rename installable ISAM file. (Error 3013)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to rename a Btrieve, dBASE, or Paradox table, but the file that contains that table could not be renamed.

Possible causes:


- The file has been defined as read-only in the operating system or by your network.
    
- In a network environment, you do not have write privileges for the file.
