# ODBC - could not find DLL <name>. (Error 3154)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Using an ODBC connection, you tried to perform an operation that requires the specified DLL.

Possible causes:


- The DLL file is on a network drive and the network is not connected. Make sure the network is available, and then try the operation again.
    
- The DLL file was not installed properly. Reinstall the ODBC driver, and then try the operation again.
