# Database is already replicable. (Error 3784)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The database is already replicable and cannot be made replicable again. If, in the database there exist local objects you want replicated, from the Design Master make the objects replicable by setting the replicable property to True.
