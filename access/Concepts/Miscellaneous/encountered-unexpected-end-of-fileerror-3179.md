# Encountered unexpected end of file. (Error 3179)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to import a file that contains an end-of-file marker in an unexpected position.

Possible causes:


- The import file is corrupted. Restore a backup copy of the import file, and then try the operation again.
    
- The import/export specifications you are using do not match the data in the import file. Edit the import/export specifications, and then try the operation again.
