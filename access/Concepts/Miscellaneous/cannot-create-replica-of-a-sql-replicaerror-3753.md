# Cannot create replica of a SQL replica. (Error 3753)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

A Microsoft SQL replica set supports a hub/spoke topology, where the SQL Publication is the hub and the Jet Subscriber is the spoke. If additional Jet replicas are desired, you must create an additional Push/Pull Subscription from the SQL Publication.
