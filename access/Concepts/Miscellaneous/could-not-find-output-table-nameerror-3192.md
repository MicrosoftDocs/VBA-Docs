# Could not find output table <name>. (Error 3192)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to use an INSERT INTO statement with the specified table, which does not exist. Make sure you entered the name correctly, and then try the operation again.

If you are attempting to execute a make-table query that creates the table for you, use the SELECT INTO syntax instead.
