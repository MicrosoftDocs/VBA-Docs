# In operator without (). (Error 2429)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

When coding an SQL statement that includes the  **In** operator, you must surround the list of items to test with parentheses. For example, to see if a value is one of a set of values, you could use the following code in the WHERE clause of an SQL query:




```vb
WHERE Region In ('TX', 'CA', 'WA')

```

This code tests to see if the Region field contains any of the above abbreviations, which represent Texas, California, and Washington.
