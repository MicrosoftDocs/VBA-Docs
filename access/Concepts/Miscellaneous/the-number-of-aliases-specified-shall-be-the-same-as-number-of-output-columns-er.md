# The number of aliases specified shall be the same as number of output columns (Error 3731)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

This error occurs when trying to create a view through SQL DDL. The error occurs when a different number of correlation names or aliases are defined from what is in the SELECT statement. For example, the following syntax would generate this error: CREATE VIEW foo (col1, col2) AS SELECT col1 FROM table1.
