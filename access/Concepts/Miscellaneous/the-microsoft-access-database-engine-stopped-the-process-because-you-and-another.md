# The Microsoft Access database engine stopped the process because you and another user are attempting to change the same data at the same time. (Error 3197)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

This error can occur in a multiuser environment.

Another user has changed the data you are trying to update. This error can occur when multiple users open a table or create a  **Recordset** and use optimistic locking. Between the time you used the **Edit** method and the **Update** method, another user changed the same data.
To overwrite the other user's changes with your own, execute the  **Update** method again.
