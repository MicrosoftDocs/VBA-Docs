# SELECT INTO on a remote database tried to produce too many fields. (Error 3185)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The Microsoft Access database engine supports up to 255 fields per table, but the other database supports fewer fields. A SELECT...INTO statement created a table with more fields than the remote database can support. Reduce the number of columns produced by the SELECT INTO statement, and then try the operation again.
