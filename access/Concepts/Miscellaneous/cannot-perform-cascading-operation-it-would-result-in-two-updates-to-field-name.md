# Cannot perform cascading operation. It would result in two updates to field <name> in table <name>. (Error 3400)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The cascade operation you are attempting cannot be completed because it would result in two separate updates to the indicated field. Check the values you are attempting to update, and fix them so that either:



- The field is updated only one time.
    
- If the field is updated more than once, the result of each update to the field is the same.
