# ADO for Visual C++ syntax index with #import

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

This index is a cross-reference to the ADO Language Reference based on Microsoft Visual C++ and the **#import** directive.

This particular index was derived by compiling a program with the **#import** directive against the ADO .dll, and then reformatting the *.tlh file that was generated. Only information about methods, properties, and events was preserved. The alternative syntax declared for each property is listed by the corresponding "" directive.

We recommend that you read [Visual C++ ADO Programming](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/visual-c-ado-programming) for more information.

Method and property syntax in Visual C++ with the **#import** directive is listed for the following elements:

- [ADO collections](collections-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)    
- [Command object](command-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)   
- [Connection object](connection-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)    
- [Error object](error-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)   
- [Field object](field-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)   
- [Parameter object](parameter-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)   
- [Property object](property-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)    
- [Record object](record-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)    
- [Recordset object](recordset-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)    
- [Stream object](stream-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)    
- [Connection events](connectionevents-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)    
- [Recordset events](recordsetevents-visual-c-plus-plus-syntax-index-with-import.md)
