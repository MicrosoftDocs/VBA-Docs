# ORDER BY clause <clause> conflicts with DISTINCT. (Error 3093)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You created an SQL statement with an ALL, DISTINCT, or DISTINCTROW predicate and an ORDER BY clause that contains a field not listed in the SELECT statement. Remove the DISTINCT reserved word, or remove the specified field from the ORDER BY clause.
