# Field will not fit in record. (Error 3016)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to import or paste a field that is too large. Consider breaking the field into smaller pieces and then importing or pasting the data to multiple fields or changing the data type of the field.

Records are limited to just under 2K in size, excluding Memo and OLE Object fields.
