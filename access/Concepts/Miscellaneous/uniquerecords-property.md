# UniqueRecords property

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You can use the **UniqueRecords** property to specify whether to return only unique records based on all fields in the underlying data source, not just those fields present in the query itself.

> [!NOTE] 
> The **UniqueRecords** property applies only to append and make-table action queries and select queries.


## Setting

The **UniqueRecords** property uses the following settings.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Yes|Doesn't return duplicate records.|
|No|(Default) Returns duplicate records.|

You can set the **UniqueRecords** property in the query's property sheet or in SQL view of the Query window.

> [!NOTE] 
> You set this property when you create a new query by using an SQL statement. The DISTINCTROW predicate corresponds to the **UniqueRecords** property setting. The DISTINCT predicate corresponds to the **UniqueValues** property setting.


## Remarks

You can use the **UniqueRecords** property when you want to omit data based on entire duplicate records, not just duplicate fields. Microsoft Access considers a record to be unique as long as the value in one field in the record differs from the value in the same field in another record.

The **UniqueRecords** property has an effect only when you use more than one table in the query and select fields from the tables used in the query. The **UniqueRecords** property is ignored if the query includes only one table.

The **UniqueRecords** and **UniqueValues** properties are related in that only one of them can be set to Yes at a time. When you set **UniqueRecords** to Yes, for example, Microsoft Access automatically sets **UniqueValues** to No. You can, however, set both of them to No. When both properties are set to No, all records are returned.


## Example

The query in this example returns a list of customers from the Customers table who have at least one order in the Orders table.


### Customers table

|**Company name**|**Customer ID**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Ernst Handel|ERNSH|
|Familia Arquibaldo|FAMIA|
|FISSA Fabrica Inter. Salchichas S.A.|FISSA|
|Folies gourmandes|FOLIG|

### Orders table

|**Customer ID**|**Order ID**|
|:-----|:-----|
|ERNSH|10698|
|FAMIA|10512|
|FAMIA|10725|
|FOLIG|10763|
|FOLIG|10408|

The following SQL statement returns the customer names in the following table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCTROW Customers.CompanyName, Customers.CustomerID 
FROM Customers INNER JOIN Orders 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID; 
 
```

|**Customers returned**|**Customer ID**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Ernst Handel|ERNSH|
|Familia Arquibaldo|FAMIA|
|Folies gourmandes|FOLIG|
