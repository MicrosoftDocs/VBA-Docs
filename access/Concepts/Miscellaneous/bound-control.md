# Bound Control

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

A bound control is a control on a form or report that gets its contents from a field in the underlying table, query, or SQL statement. (The control's  **ControlSource** property is set to a field name in the table, query, or SQL statement.) For example, a text box that displays an employee's last name is bound to the LastName field in the Employees table.
