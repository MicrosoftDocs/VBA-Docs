# <Path> is not a valid path. Make sure that the path name is spelled correctly and that you are connected to the server on which the file resides. (Error 3044)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Possible causes:



- You entered an invalid file specification that contains an invalid path. For example, you might have entered a path that does not exist or misspelled an element in the path specification.
    
- The specified file is on a network drive and you are not connected to that drive. Make sure the network is available, and then try the operation again.
