# Cannot open action query <name>. (Error 3064)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to open an action query using the **OpenQueryDef** method, which is an obsolete method originally valid only with select queries. The preferred method for executing an action query is to use the **Execute** method of the **QueryDef** object.
