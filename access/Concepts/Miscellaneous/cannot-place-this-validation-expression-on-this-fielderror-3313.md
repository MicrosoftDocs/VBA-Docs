# Cannot place this validation expression on this field. (Error 3313)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You are trying to set validation properties on a field (such as an AutoNumber or OLE Object field) that does not allow this type of property. Use a different field to validate data or, if you have not added data to the table, redefine the data type for the field.
