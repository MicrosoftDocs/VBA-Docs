# Cannot append a Field that is already a part of a Fields collection. (Error 3266).

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

A  **Field** object was specified as an argument to an **Append** operation when it already is a member of an existing **Fields** collection. Use the **Dim** statement and **CreateField** method to declare a new **Field** object and specify its values, and retry the operation with the new **Field** object.
