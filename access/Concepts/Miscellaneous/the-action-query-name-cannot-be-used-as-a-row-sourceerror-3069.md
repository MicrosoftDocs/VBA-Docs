# The action query <name> cannot be used as a row source. (Error 3069)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You cannot use the name of an action query here. Instead, use the name of a select query. To run an action query, use the  **Execute** method instead of the name of an action query as input to the FROM clause.
