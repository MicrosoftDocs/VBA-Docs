# Cannot make the <name> table replicable due to too many columns. (Error 3705)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The table cannot be made replicable since replication system columns cannot be added. Adding these columns would exceed the column limit. Reduce the number of columns in the table prior to making it replicable.
