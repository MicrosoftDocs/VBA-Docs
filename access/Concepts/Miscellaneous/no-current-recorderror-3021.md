# No current record. (Error 3021)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

This error occurs after the unsuccessful application of one of the Find methods or the  **Seek** method, when the underlying **Recordset** contains no records or the record has been deleted. Move to or select another record, and try the operation again. If the **Recordset** is empty, you cannot position to a current record. Check the **BOF** and **EOF** properties.
