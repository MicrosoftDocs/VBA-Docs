# This table contains cells that are outside of the range of cells defined in this spreadsheet. (Error 3673)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The spreadsheet file that is being read is not correctly formed. It contains data outside the range that was specified in the file header information. The spreadsheet driver cannot read the data reliably if it is not properly formed.

The file may not be a spreadsheet file or it may have become corrupted. Try reading the file into the original spreadsheet product and then re-writing it to another file. The spreadsheet product may be able to fix the errors.
