# Update/RI conflict. (Error 3718)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The primary key record has been updated by another replica, therefore this referencing record has been rejected. Either create a new primary key record that satisfies the referential integrity constraint and then resubmit your update, modify the foreign key value in this conflict record to match a valid primary key value and then resubmit your update, or delete this conflict record.
