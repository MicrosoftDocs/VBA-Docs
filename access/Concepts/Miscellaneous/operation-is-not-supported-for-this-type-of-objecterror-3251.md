# Operation is not supported for this type of object. (Error 3251)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You were attempting to execute a method or assign a value to a property that is usually valid for the object, but is not supported in this specific instance. For example, the  **Edit** method is generally valid for **Recordset** objects, but not for a snapshot-type **Recordset**. This error could also occur in cases where the operation is not permitted due to the type or status of the object â€” as when trying to use the **MovePrevious** method on a forward-only-type **Recordset**. Some operations are also not supported, depending on if you are accessing a Microsoft Access database engine or an ODBC data source.
