**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Possible causes:



- The file you tried to read or link is corrupted. Restore a backup copy of the file to your disk, and then try the operation again.
    
- The file format is not recognized. If the file is a Btrieve, dBASE, or Paradox file, run Setup to install the installable ISAM, and then link the file.
