# The table <name> is already opened exclusively by another user, or it is already open through the user interface and cannot be manipulated programmatically. (Error 3008)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to use a table that is currently open for exclusive access by another user, or you tried to programmatically manipulate a table that is open through the user interface. Address the appropriate condition, and then try the operation again.
