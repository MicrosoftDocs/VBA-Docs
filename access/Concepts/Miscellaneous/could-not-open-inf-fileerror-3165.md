# Could not open .inf file. (Error 3165)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to link a dBASE table, but the associated .inf file that contains index information about that table could not be opened or created.

Possible causes:


- There is not enough disk space available to create the .inf file.
    
- In a network environment, you do not have write privileges for the network drive.
