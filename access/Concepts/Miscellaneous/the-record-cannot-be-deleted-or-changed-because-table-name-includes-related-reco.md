# The record cannot be deleted or changed because table <name> includes related records. (Error 3200)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to perform an operation that would have violated referential integrity rules for related tables. For example, this error occurs if you try to delete or change a record in the "one" table in a one-to-many relationship when there are related records in the "many" table.

If you want to delete or change the record, first delete the related records from the "many" table.
