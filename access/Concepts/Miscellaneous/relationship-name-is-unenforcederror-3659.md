# Relationship <name> is unenforced. (Error 3659)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You attempted to apply a filter in a partial replica on a table where a relationship that is not enforced exists. Enforce the relationship at the Design Master, and then re-attempt to apply the filter and re-populate the partial replica.
