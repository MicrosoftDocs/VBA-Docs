# Item not found in this collection. (Error 3265)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

An attempt to reference a name in a collection failed.

Possible causes:


- The object does not exist in this collection. Make sure the object is appended to a collection before referencing it.
    
- There is more than one object with this name in the collection; using its name is an ambiguous reference. Reference the object by its ordinal position in the collection (for example,  `Recordsets(3)`).
