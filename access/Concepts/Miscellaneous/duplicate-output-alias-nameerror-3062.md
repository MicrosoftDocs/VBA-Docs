# Duplicate output alias <name>. (Error 3062)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to execute an SQL statement that has more than one alias with the same name. The following statement, for example, would produce this error:




```sql
SELECT LastName AS Name, FirstName AS Name FROM Employees;

```

Rename one or more of the aliases, and then try the operation again.
