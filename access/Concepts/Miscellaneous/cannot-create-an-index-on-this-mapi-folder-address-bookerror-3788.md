# Cannot create an index on this MAPI folder/address book. (Error 3788)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Many Microsoft Outlook/Exchange folders and address books are system-wide components that you cannot modify in any way. This error message indicates that you tried to create an index on an object, such as a global address list or a public folder, for which you do not have permissions.
