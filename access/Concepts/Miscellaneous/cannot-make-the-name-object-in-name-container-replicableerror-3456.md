# Cannot make the <name> object in <name> container replicable. (Error 3456)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The Microsoft Access database engine was in the process of making the object replicable. The operation failed because there were insufficient resources to manipulate the object. If the object is a table, make sure the total number of fields after replication does not exceed 255 and the total number of bytes in a record does not exceed 2048. If the number of fields or characters is over the limit, decrease the size of the record.
