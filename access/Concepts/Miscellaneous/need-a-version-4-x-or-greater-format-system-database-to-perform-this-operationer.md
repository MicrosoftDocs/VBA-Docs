# Need a version 4.x or greater format system database to perform this operation. (Error 3808)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

When using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Jet with security, it is necessary that the security database be in a Jet version 4.x file format. This can be done by compacting the existing security database or by creating a new one through the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Jet.
