# Could not delete from specified tables. (Error 3086)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to delete data from one or more tables, but the deletion could not be completed.

Possible causes:


- You do not have permission to modify the table. To change your permissions assignments, see your system administrator or the table's creator.
    
- The database was opened for read-only access. The database is read-only for one of these reasons:
    
    
    
      - You used the  **OpenDatabase** method and opened the database for read-only access.
    
  - The database file is defined as read-only in the database server operating system or by your network.
    
  - In a network environment, you do not have write privileges for the database file.
    
  - In Microsoft Visual Basic, you used the  **Data** control and set the **ReadOnly** property to **True**.
    

    
    

To delete the data, close the database, resolve the read-only condition, and then reopen the file for read/write access.
