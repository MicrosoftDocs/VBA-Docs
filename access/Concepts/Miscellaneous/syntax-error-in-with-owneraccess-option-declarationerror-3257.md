# Syntax error in WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION declaration. (Error 3257)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Possible causes:



- The WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION declaration is incomplete or includes a space between OWNER and ACCESS.
    
- The declaration appears in an unexpected and disallowed position in the SQL statement. For example:
    
```sql
  SELECT * WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION FROM [My Table]; 

```


    The WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION declaration should appear at the end of the SQL statement, usually after the ORDER BY clause, if present:
    


```sql
  SELECT * FROM [My Table] WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION;
```
