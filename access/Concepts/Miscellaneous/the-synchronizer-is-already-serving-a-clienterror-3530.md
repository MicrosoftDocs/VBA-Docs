# The Synchronizer is already serving a client. (Error 3530)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You are attempting to start a second client of the Synchronizer, but the Synchronizer can have only one client at a time. Identify the application or user that is already using the Synchronizer and close the application.
