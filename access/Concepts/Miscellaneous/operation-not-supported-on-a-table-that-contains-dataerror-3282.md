# Operation not supported on a table that contains data. (Error 3282)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You cannot add a field or create an index on a linked table that contains data. Once a table is populated with data, you cannot change the table design or indexes. Create a new table with the altered design and transfer the data to it using an action query.
