# Cannot create this type of replica from the given source replica. (Error 3737)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You cannot create a replica of a different visibility, except from a Global replica. For example, a Local replica can only create another Local replica, and an Anonymous replica can only create another Anonymous replica. Global replicas can create Global, Local, or Anonymous replicas.
