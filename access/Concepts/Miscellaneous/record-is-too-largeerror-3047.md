# Record is too large. (Error 3047)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You defined or imported a table with records larger than 4K. This error occurs when you enter data into the record — not when you define the table structure. Redefine the table by making some fields shorter, removing unneeded fields, or moving some fields to other tables.
