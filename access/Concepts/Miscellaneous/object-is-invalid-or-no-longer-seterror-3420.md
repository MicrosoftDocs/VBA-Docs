# Object is invalid or no longer set. (Error 3420)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You are attempting to reference an object that is no longer valid or has not been set.

Possible causes:


- The object has been closed.
    
- The object has been orphaned (the parent object has been closed or deleted).
    
- The object is out of scope.
    
- The object library is not registered in the Microsoft Windows Registry.
    
- You are trying to reference a method or property of the collection, but you have not assigned it to a variable first. For example, to reference the  **Name** property, use the following:
    
```vb
  Dim dbsPublish As Database 
Set dbsPublish = OpenDatabase("BIBLIO.mdb")
dbname = dbsPublish.Name

```
