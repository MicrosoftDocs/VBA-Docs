# Relationship must be on the same number of fields with the same data types. (Error 3368)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The CONSTRAINT clause you are using to create a relationship includes a different number of fields for each table or includes fields with different data types. Check the number of fields in the CONSTRAINT clause, check the data types of fields to make sure they match, and try again.
