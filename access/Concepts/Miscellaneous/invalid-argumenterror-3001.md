# Invalid argument. (Error 3001)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to perform an operation that involves a routine in a DLL, and one of the arguments to the routine is invalid. Check your entry to make sure you have specified the correct arguments, and then try the operation again.

This error also occurs when you attempt to use mutually exclusive constants in an argument to a method, such as specifying both **dbConsistent** and **dbInconsistent** in the _options_ argument to the **OpenRecordset** method.
