# Cannot append. An object with that name already exists in the collection. (Error 3367)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to append an object to a collection that already contains an object of the same name. Use the  **Refresh** method on the collection and check to see whether the object you want to append already exists, or try changing the object's **Name** property setting.
