# Local or Anonymous replicas must synch only to their designated hub replica. (Error 3738)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The source replica is a Local or Anonymous replica; you are trying to exchange to the wrong hub replica. You can only synchronize a Local or Anonymous replica with the Global replica that created it.
