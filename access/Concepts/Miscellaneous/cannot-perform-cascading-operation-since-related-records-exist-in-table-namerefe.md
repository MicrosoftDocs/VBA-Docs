# Cannot perform cascading operation. Since related records exist in table <name>, referential integrity rules would be violated. (Error 3396)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The cascade operation you are attempting violates referential integrity rules with the indicated table. Check the values you are attempting to update or delete, and fix them so they comply with the referential integrity rules.
