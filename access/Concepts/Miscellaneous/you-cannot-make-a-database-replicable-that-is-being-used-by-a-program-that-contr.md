# You cannot make a database replicable that is being used by a program that controls modification. (Error 3638)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The database you are trying to replicate is controlled by a database program that does not support replication. To be able to make the database replicable you must ensure it is not being controlled by the source control program.
