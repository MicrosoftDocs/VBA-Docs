# You cannot add a second Replication ID AutoNumber field to a table. (Error 3486)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The table you are attempting to change already has one field that uses the Replication ID AutoNumber (or GUID) data type. If you are attempting to create a second Replication ID field to serve as a foreign key, use the Number data type instead of the AutoNumber data type.
