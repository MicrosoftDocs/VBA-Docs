# The operation failed. There are too many indexes on table <name>. Delete some of the indexes on the table and try the operation again. (Error 3626)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

A table in a Microsoft Access database engine database can have no more than 32 indexes. You cannot create additional indexes on a table with this many indexes.

Delete one or more indexes from the named table and try the operation again.
