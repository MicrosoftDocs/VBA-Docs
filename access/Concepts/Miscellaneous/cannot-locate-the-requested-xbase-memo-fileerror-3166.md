# Cannot locate the requested Xbase memo file. (Error 3166)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to access a dBASE (.dbf) file, but the file's associated memo (.dbt) file could not be found. Make sure the .dbt file is in the same directory as the .dbf file, and then try the operation again.
