# Recovered replicable data. (Error 3711)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

When a replica is recovered, any new records that existed in the corrupted replica are added to the conflict table of the recovered replica. This ensures that the data can be reviewed before it is reinserted.
