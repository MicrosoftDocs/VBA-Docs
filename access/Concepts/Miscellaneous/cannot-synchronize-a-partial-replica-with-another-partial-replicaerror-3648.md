# Cannot synchronize a partial replica with another partial replica. (Error 3648)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The database you are trying to synchronize with is a partial replica. You cannot synchronize a partial replica with another partial replica, because the other partial replica may not contain all records that satisfy your partial replica's filter.
