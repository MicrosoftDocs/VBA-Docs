# Crosstab Query

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

A crosstab query computes summary totals based on values for each row and column. It calculates a sum, average, count, or other type of total on records, and then groups the result by two types of information â€” one down the left side of the datasheet and the other across the top.
