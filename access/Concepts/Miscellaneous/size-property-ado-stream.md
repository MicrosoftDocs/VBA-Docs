# Size property (ADO stream)

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Indicates the size of the stream in number of bytes.

## Return values

Returns a **Long** value that specifies the size of the stream in number of bytes. The default value is the size of the stream, or -1 if the size of the stream is not known.


## Remarks

**Size** can be used only with open [Stream](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d49b1514-e0b4-0aca-d5c2-8266f3f4fe65%28Office.15%29.aspx) objects.

> [!NOTE] 
> Any number of bits can be stored in a **Stream** object, limited only by system resources. If the **Stream** contains more bits than can be represented by a **Long** value, **Size** is truncated and therefore does not accurately represent the length of the **Stream**.
