# You cannot change the data master attribute for the replica set. (Error 3593)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Whether a replica set allows users to change data at all replicas or only at the Design Master is determined when the database is first converted into a Design Master. After the database has been converted, the single or multiple data master attribute cannot be changed.
