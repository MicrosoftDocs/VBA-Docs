# SourceConnectStr, SourceDatabase properties

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You can use these properties to access external data when you can't link the external tables to your database.

- The **SourceConnectStr** property specifies the name of the application used to create an external database.
    
- The **SourceDatabase** property specifies the external database in which the source tables or queries for a query reside.
    
> [!NOTE] 
> The **SourceConnectStr** and **SourceDatabase** properties apply to all queries except data-definition, pass-through, and union queries.


## Setting

You use a string expression to set the value of the **SourceConnectStr** and **SourceDatabase** properties.

You can set these properties in the query's property sheet or in SQL view of the Query window. In the SQL statement, the properties correspond to the IN clause.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you are accessing multiple database sources, use the **Source** property instead of the **SourceConnectStr** and **SourceDatabase** properties.


## Remarks

You must use the **SourceConnectStr** and **SourceDatabase** properties to access tables from external databases that were created in applications that don't use linked tables.

The following are examples of these property settings:

- For a Microsoft Access database, the **SourceDatabase** property setting is the path and database name (for example, C:\Accounts\Customers). Microsoft Access adds the file name extension automatically. The **SourceConnectStr** property doesn't have a value for a Microsoft Access database.
    
- For a database created by a product such as Paradox, the **SourceDatabase** property setting is the path (for example, C:\Pdoxdata). The **SourceConnectStr** property setting is the specifier for the database type (for example, Paradox 3.x;). For a list of specifiers, see the DAO **Connect** property.
    
- The following example uses dBASE IV tables in the C:\Dbdata directory as the source of data for the query.
    
  ```sql
    SELECT Customer.COMPANYNAM, Orders.ORDERID, Orders.ORDERDATE 
  FROM Customer INNER JOIN Orders 
  ON Customer.CUSTOMERID = Orders.CUSTOMERID 
  IN 'C:\Dbdata'[dBASE IV;];
  ```

- For an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) database, the **SourceConnectStr** property setting is the name of the source database and any additional information required by the product, such as a logon identification (ID) and password. For example, for a Microsoft SQL Server database the setting might be:
    
  ```sql
    ODBC;DSN=salessrv;UID=jace;PWD=password;DATABASE=sales;
  ```


The **SourceDatabase** property doesn't have a value for an ODBC database.
