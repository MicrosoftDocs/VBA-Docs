# Cannot repeat table name <name> in FROM clause. (Error 3074)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You cannot list the table name more than once. Remove the extra occurrences of the table name or use an alias. If you are trying to join a table to itself, use an alias to change the second reference to the table.
