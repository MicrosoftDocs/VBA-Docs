# Cannot perform this operation; features in this version are not available in databases with older formats. (Error 3301)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The database was stored in an earlier version of the Microsoft Access database engine that does not support this feature. Either the database needs to be converted to the latest file format or this particular operation needs to be revised to avoid using the unsupported feature.
