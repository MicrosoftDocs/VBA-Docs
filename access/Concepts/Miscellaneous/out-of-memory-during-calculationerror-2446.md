# Out of memory during calculation. (Error 2446)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The application does not have enough memory to complete the calculation. Make sure you have enough RAM and an established swap file. You may need to terminate other programs, remove desktop wallpaper bitmaps, or remove unneeded device drivers to recover enough memory.
