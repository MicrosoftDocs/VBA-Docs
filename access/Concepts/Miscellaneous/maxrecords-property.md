# MaxRecords property

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Specifies the maximum number of records that will be returned by:

- A query that returns data from an ODBC database to a Microsoft Access database. 
    
- A view that returns data from a SQL database to an Access project (.adp). 
    

## Setting

The **MaxRecords** property setting is a Long Integer value representing the number of records that will be returned.

In a Microsoft Access database, you can set this property by using the query's property sheet or Visual Basic.


## Remarks

When you set this property in Visual Basic, you use the ADO **MaxRecords** property.

Records are returned in the order specified by the query's ORDER BY clause.

You can use the **MaxRecords** property in situations where limited system resources might prohibit a large number of returned records.
