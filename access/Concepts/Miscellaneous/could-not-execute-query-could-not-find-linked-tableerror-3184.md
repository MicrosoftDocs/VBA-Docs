# Could not execute query; could not find linked table. (Error 3184)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Possible causes:



- The linked table no longer exists or has been renamed or moved. Link the table and then try to execute the query again.
    
- The linked table is on a network drive, and you are not connected to the network. Make sure the network is available, and then try to execute the query again.
