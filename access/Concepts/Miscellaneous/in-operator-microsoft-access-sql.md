# In operator (Microsoft Access SQL)

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Determines whether the value of an expression is equal to any of several values in a specified list.

## Syntax

_expr_ [ **Not** ] **In**( _value1, value2, â€¦_ )


## Remarks

The **In** operator syntax has these parts:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _expr_|Expression identifying the field that contains the data you want to evaluate.|
| _value1_, _value2_|Expression or list of expressions against which you want to evaluate _expr_.|

If _expr_ is found in the list of values, the **In** operator returns **True**; otherwise, it returns **False**. You can include the **Not** logical operator to evaluate the opposite condition (that is, whether _expr_ is not in the list of values).

For example, you can use **In** to determine which orders are shipped to a set of specified regions:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Orders 
WHERE ShipRegion In ('Avon','Glos','Som')
```


## Example

The following example uses the Orders table in the Northwind.mdb database to create a query that includes all orders shipped to Lancashire and Essex and the dates shipped. 

This example calls the EnumFields procedure, which you can find in the SELECT statement example.

```vb
Sub InX() 
 
    Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset 
 
    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
    ' on your computer. 
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
    ' Select records from the Orders table that 
    ' have a ShipRegion value of Lancashire or Essex. 
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("SELECT " _ 
        & "CustomerID, ShippedDate FROM Orders " _ 
        & "WHERE ShipRegion In " _ 
        & "('Lancashire','Essex');") 
     
    ' Populate the Recordset. 
    rst.MoveLast 
     
    ' Call EnumFields to print the contents of 
    ' the Recordset. 
    EnumFields rst, 12 
 
    dbs.Close 
 
End Sub
```
