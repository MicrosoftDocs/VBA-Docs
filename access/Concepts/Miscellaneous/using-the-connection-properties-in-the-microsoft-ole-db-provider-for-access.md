# Using the Connection Properties in the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Access

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

To customize the Microsoft® Windows® Registry settings, you can use the connection properties in the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Access. This is accomplished by referencing a property in the connection object and changing its value. For example, assuming that your connection object is called ADOConnection, the following would yield the same results as going through ADO: 

ADOConnection.Properties("Jet OLEDB:Max Locks Per File") = 20000
The property names are different than the DAO constants and the registry settings. The property names are as follows:
Jet OLEDB:Max Locks Per File
Jet OLEDB:Implicit Commit Sync
Jet OLEDB:Flush Transaction Timeout
Jet OLEDB:Lock Delay
Jet OLEDB:Max Buffer Size
Jet OLEDB:User Commit Sync
Jet OLEDB:Lock Retry
Jet OLEDB:Exclusive Async Delay
Jet OLEDB:Shared Async Delay
Jet OLEDB:Page Timeout
Jet OLEDB:Recycle Long-Valued Pages
