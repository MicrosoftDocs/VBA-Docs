# Resultant table not allowed to have more than one AutoNumber field. (Error 3090)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You tried to execute a query that would result in a table with more than one field that has an AutoNumber data type. Change the query to include only one AutoNumber field.
