# Required property (Access)

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You can use the **Required** property to specify whether a value is required in a field. If this property is set to Yes, when you enter data in a record, you must enter a value in the field or in any control bound to the field, and the value cannot be **Null**. 

For example, you might want to be sure that a LastName control has a value for each record. When you want to permit **Null** values in a field, you must not only set the **Required** property to No but, if there is a **ValidationRule** property setting, it must also explicitly state " _validationrule_ Or Is Null".

> [!NOTE] 
> The **Required** property doesn't apply to AutoNumber fields.


## Setting

The **Required** property uses the following settings.

|**Setting**|**Visual Basic**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Yes|**True** (-1)|The field requires a value.|
|No|**False** (0)|(Default) The field doesn't require a value.|

You can set this property for all table fields (except AutoNumber data type fields) by using the table's property sheet or Visual Basic.

> [!NOTE] 
> To access a field's **Required** property in Visual Basic, use the DAO **Required** property.


## Remarks

The **Required** property is enforced at the table level by the Microsoft Jet database engine. If you set this property to Yes, the field must receive or already contain a value when it has the focus â€” when a user enters data in a table (or in a form or datasheet based on the table), when a macro or Visual Basic sets the value of the field, or when data is imported into the table.

You can use the **Required** and **AllowZeroLength** properties to differentiate between information that doesn't exist (stored as a zero-length string (" ") in the field) and information that may exist but is unknown (stored as a **Null** value in the field). 

If you set the **AllowZeroLength** property to Yes, a zero-length string will be a valid entry in the field regardless of the **Required** property setting. 

If you set **Required** to Yes and **AllowZeroLength** to No, you must enter a value in the field, and a zero-length string won't be a valid entry.

> [!TIP] 
> You can use an input mask when data is entered in a field to distinguish between the display of a **Null** value and a zero-length string. For example, the string "None" could be displayed when a zero-length string is entered.

The following table shows the results you can expect when you combine the settings of the **Required** and **AllowZeroLength** properties.

|**Required**|**AllowZeroLength**|**User's action**|**Value stored**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|No|No|Presses ENTER<br/>Presses SPACEBAR<br/>Enters a zero-length string|**Null**<br/>**Null**<br/>(not allowed)|
|No|Yes|Presses ENTER<br/>Presses SPACEBAR<br/>Enters a zero-length string|**Null**<br/>**Null**<br/>Zero-length string|
|Yes|No|Presses ENTER<br/>Presses SPACEBAR<br/>Enters a zero-length string|(not allowed)<br/>(not allowed)<br/>(not allowed)|
|Yes|Yes|Presses ENTER<br/>Presses SPACEBAR<br/>Enters a zero-length string|(not allowed)<br/>Zero-length string<br/>Zero-length string|

If you set the **Required** property to Yes for a field in a table that already contains data, Microsoft Access gives you the option of checking whether the field has a value in all existing records. However, you can require that a value be entered in this field in all new records even if there are existing records with **Null** values in the field.

> [!NOTE] 
> To enforce a relationship between related tables that don't allow **Null** values, set the **Required** property of the foreign key field in the related table to Yes. The Jet database engine then ensures that you have a related record in the parent table before you can create a record in the child table. If the foreign key field is part of the primary key of the child table, this is unnecessary, because a primary key field can't contain a **Null** value.
