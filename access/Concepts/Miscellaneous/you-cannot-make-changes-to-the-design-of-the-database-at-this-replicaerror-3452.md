# You cannot make changes to the design of the database at this replica. (Error 3452)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Changes to the design of a replicated database can be made only at the Design Master. The replica you are attempting to change is not the Design Master for the replica set. Locate the Design Master and make your changes there.
