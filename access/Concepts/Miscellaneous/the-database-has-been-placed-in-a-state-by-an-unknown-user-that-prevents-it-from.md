# The database has been placed in a state by an unknown user that prevents it from being opened or locked. (Error 3733)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

This error occurs when the new passive shutdown/connection control is being used. This error indicates that another user set the database in a mode that will prevent other users from opening it. It is related to error #3734 and is used when the Microsoft Access database engine cannot determine which user invoked the passive shutdown/connection control.
