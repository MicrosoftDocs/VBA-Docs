# There are several tables with that name. Please specify owner in the format 'owner.table'. (Error 3298)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

More than one table with that name exists in the remote ODBC data source. To resolve the ambiguity, specify the owner of the table you want to access, using the  _owner.table_ syntax.
