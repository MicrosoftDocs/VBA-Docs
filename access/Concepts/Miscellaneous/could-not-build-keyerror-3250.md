# Could not build key. (Error 3250)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

When building a primary index, the Microsoft Access database engine could not build a primary key. Make sure the key fields are named properly and that there are no duplicate records based on this key.

This error can occur when you use the  **Seek** method and pass it a value for a field that is not part of the index. For example, suppose you want to use the **Seek** method on a **Recordset** whose current index uses the LastName field of the underlying table, and you write it this way:



```
rstEmployees.Seek "=", "Smith", "Joe"

```

The Microsoft Access database engine will try to construct a primary key from two fields, but because one field is indexed, the attempt will fail and this error results.
