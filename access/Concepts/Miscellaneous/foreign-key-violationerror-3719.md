# Foreign key violation. (Error 3719)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

This foreign key violation results from an invalid primary key record that was involved in a replication conflict. Either create a new primary key record that satisfies the referential integrity constraint and then resubmit your update, modify the foreign key value in this conflict record to match a valid primary key value and then resubmit this conflict record, or delete this conflict record.
