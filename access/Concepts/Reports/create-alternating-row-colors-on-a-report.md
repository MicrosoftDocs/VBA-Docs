# Create alternating row colors on a report

By default, Access formats each row of a report's detail section with the same background color. When printing a report, shading every other line of the detail section can make it much easier to read. You can use the **[AlternateBackColor](../../../api/Access.Section.AlternateBackColor.md)** property to specify a color to be displayed or printed on every other line in the detail section when viewing or printing a report.

The following example illustrates how to display light gray bars on every other line of the report's detail section when it is printed.

```vb
Private Sub Detail_Print(Cancel As Integer, PrintCount As Integer) 
 
    Me.Section("Detail").AlternateBackColor = RGB(240, 240, 240) 
     
End Sub
```
