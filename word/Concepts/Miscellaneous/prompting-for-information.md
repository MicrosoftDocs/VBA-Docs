# Prompting for Information

There are several different ways you can prompt for information from a user.


- Use the Visual Basic **InputBox** function to display a dialog box with a message and an edit box. When the user clicks **OK**, the function returns the text that the user entered.
    
- Use the Visual Basic **MsgBox** function to display a simple message. You can display several different command buttons and icons. This function returns a number that indicates which button was clicked.
    
- Use a  [built-in Microsoft Word dialog box](../Customizing-Word/displaying-built-in-word-dialog-boxes.md)to get user input for a specific Word feature.
    
- Use a custom form to get user input. For information about adding controls to a form, see  [Add a control to a form](../Customizing-Word/adding-controls-to-a-document.md).
