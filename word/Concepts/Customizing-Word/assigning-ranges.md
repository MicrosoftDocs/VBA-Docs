# Assigning Ranges

There are several ways to assign an existing **[Range](../../../api/Word.Range.md)** object to a variable. This topic explains the results of two different techniques. In the following examples, the `Range1` and `Range2` variables refer to **Range** objects. For example, the following instructions assign the first and second words in the active document to the `Range1` and `Range2` variables.


```vb
Set Range1 = ActiveDocument.Words(1) 
Set Range2 = ActiveDocument.Words(2)
```


## Setting a Range object variable equal to another Range object variable

The following instruction assigns a range variable named **`Range2` to represent the same location as `Range1`.


```vb
Set Range2 = Range1
```

You now have two variables that represent the same range. When you manipulate the start or endpoint or the text of **`Range2`, it affects **`Range1` and vice versa.

Note that the following instruction is the same as **`Range2.Text = Range1.Text`. This instruction assigns the default property of **`Range1`, which is the **[Text](../../../api/Word.Range.Text.md)** property, to the default property of `Range2`. It doesn't change what the objects actually refer to.

```vb
Range2 = Range1
```

The ranges ( `Range2` and `Range1`) have the same contents, but they may point to different locations in the document or even different documents.


## Using the Duplicate property

The following instruction creates a new duplicated **Range** object, `Range2`, which has the same start and endpoints and text as **`Range1`.


```vb
Set Range2 = Range1.Duplicate
```

If you change the start or endpoint of **`Range1`**, it doesn't affect **`Range2,`** and vice versa. Because these two ranges point to the same location in the document, changing the text in one range affects the text in the other range.
