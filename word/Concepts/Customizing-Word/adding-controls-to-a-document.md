# Adding Controls to a Document

You can add [ActiveX controls](../../../api/overview/Word.md) to a document's drawing layer or text layer. To add a control to the drawing layer, click the control on the **Control Toolbox**. Drag an adjustment handle of the control until the control's outline is the size and shape you want. To add a control to the text layer, hold down the SHIFT key while you click a control on the **Control Toolbox**. The control is automatically added to the document at the insertion point.


 **Note** Dragging a control (or a number of "grouped" controls) from the form back to the **Control Toolbox** creates a template of that control, which can be reused. This is a useful feature for implementing a standard interface for your applications.
