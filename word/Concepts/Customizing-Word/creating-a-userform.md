# Creating a UserForm

To create a custom dialog box, you must create a UserForm. To create a UserForm, click **UserForm** on the **Insert** menu in the Visual Basic Editor.

Use the Properties window to change the name, behavior, and appearance of the form. For example, to change the caption on a form, set the **Caption** property.
