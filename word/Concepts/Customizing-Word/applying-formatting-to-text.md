# Applying formatting to text

This topic includes Visual Basic examples related to the tasks in the following sections.

## Applying formatting to the selection

The following example uses the **[Selection](../../../api/Word.Application.Selection.md)** property to apply character and paragraph formatting to the selected text. Use the **[Font](../../../api/Word.Selection.Font.md)** property to access character formatting properties and methods and the **[ParagraphFormat](../../../api/Word.Selection.ParagraphFormat.md)** property to access paragraph formatting properties and methods.

```vb
Sub FormatSelection() 
 With Selection.Font 
 .Name = "Times New Roman" 
 .Size = 14 
 .AllCaps = True 
 End With 
 With Selection.ParagraphFormat 
 .LeftIndent = InchesToPoints(0.5) 
 .Space1 
 End With 
End Sub
```

## Applying formatting to a range

The following example defines a **[Range](../../../api/Word.Range.md)** object that refers to the first three paragraphs in the active document. The **Range** is formatted by applying properties of the **[Font](../../../api/Word.Font.md)** object and the **[ParagraphFormat](../../../api/Word.ParagraphFormat.md)** object.

```vb
Sub FormatRange() 
 Dim rngFormat As Range 
 Set rngFormat = ActiveDocument.Range( _ 
 Start:=ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range.Start, _ 
 End:=ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(3).Range.End) 
 With rngFormat 
 .Font.Name = "Arial" 
 .ParagraphFormat.Alignment = wdAlignParagraphJustify 
 End With 
End Sub
```

## Inserting text and applying character and paragraph formatting

The following example adds the word "Title" at the top of the current document. The first paragraph is center-aligned and one half-inch space is added after the paragraph. The word "Title" is formatted with 24-point Arial font.

```vb
Sub InsertFormatText() 
 Dim rngFormat As Range 
 Set rngFormat = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=0, End:=0) 
 With rngFormat 
 .InsertAfter Text:="Title" 
 .InsertParagraphAfter 
 With .Font 
 .Name = "Tahoma" 
 .Size = 24 
 .Bold = True 
 End With 
 End With 
 With ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1) 
 .Alignment = wdAlignParagraphCenter 
 .SpaceAfter = InchesToPoints(0.5) 
 End With 
End Sub
```

## Switching the space before a paragraph between 12 points and none

The following example toggles the space-before formatting of the first paragraph in the selection. The macro retrieves the current space before value, and if the value is 12 points, the space-before formatting is removed (the **[SpaceBefore](../../../api/Word.Paragraph.SpaceBefore.md)** property is set to zero). If the space-before value is anything other than 12, the **SpaceBefore** property is set to 12 points.

```vb
Sub ToggleParagraphSpace() 
 With Selection.Paragraphs(1) 
 If .SpaceBefore <> 0 Then 
 .SpaceBefore = 0 
 Else 
 .SpaceBefore = 6 
 End If 
 End With 
End Sub
```

## Switching bold formatting on and off

The following example toggles bold formatting of the selected text.

```vb
Sub ToggleBold() 
 Selection.Font.Bold = wdToggle
End Sub
```

## Increasing the left margin by 0.5 inch

The following example increases the left and right margins by 0.5 inch. The **[PageSetup](../../../api/Word.PageSetup.md)** object contains all the page setup attributes of a document (such as left margin, bottom margin, and paper size) as properties. The **[LeftMargin](../../../api/Word.PageSetup.LeftMargin.md)** property is used to return and set the left margin setting. The **[RightMargin](../../../api/Word.PageSetup.RightMargin.md)** property is used to return and set the right margin setting.

```vb
Sub FormatMargins() 
 With ActiveDocument.PageSetup 
 .LeftMargin = .LeftMargin + InchesToPoints(0.5) 
 .RightMargin = .RightMargin + InchesToPoints(0.5) 
 End With 
End Sub
```
