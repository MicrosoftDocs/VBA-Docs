# Adding Controls to a UserForm

To add [ActiveX controls](../../../api/overview/Word.md) to a user form, find the control you want to add in the **Toolbox**, drag the control onto the form, and then drag an adjustment handle on the control until the control's outline is the size and shape you want.


 **Note** Dragging a control (or a number of "grouped" controls) from the form back to the **Toolbox** creates a template of that control, which can be reused. This is a useful feature for implementing a standard interface for your applications.


When you've added controls to the form, use the commands on the **Format** menu in the Visual Basic Editor to adjust the control alignment and spacing.
