I'm wrote the code (below) to create an excel macro to list functon arguments of a user defined function.
The issue is:
   The list won't show more than one input parameter (  ArgDesc ( )  )
   
   In the past my colleagues have use this code and would list multiple input parameters.
   
  Is this a bug with the excel program?
   
   Sub DescribeFunction()
'This can be used to add help text to each function

   Dim FuncName As String
   Dim FuncDesc As String
   Dim Category As String
   Dim ArgDesc(1 To 2) As Variant
  
'type the function name in the quotes below
   FuncName = "OilHeat_DSN100G_LOF"

'type the help text in the quotes below
   FuncDesc = " estimates the oil heat gain in (BTU/min) from input power (hp)and airend adiabatic efficiency (%) "
   
   Category = 14 'User Defined
   
'type the argument descriptions in the quotes below.  Add more arguments as needed, and change X in Dim ArgDesc(1 To X)
 'to a number at least as large as total number of arguments
   ArgDesc(1) = " = Power, Airend input package (hp) "
   ArgDesc(2) = " = System adiabatic efficiency (%)"
   'ArgDesc(3) = "  "
         
   Application.MacroOptions _
      Macro:=FuncName, _
      Description:=FuncDesc, _
      Category:=Category, _
      ArgumentDescriptions:=ArgDesc()

'run the macro called DescribeFunction, then save

End Sub
