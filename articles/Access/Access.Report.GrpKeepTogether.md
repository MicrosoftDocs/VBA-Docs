# Report.GrpKeepTogether Property (Access)

You can use the  **GrpKeepTogether** property to specify whether groups in a multiple column report that have their **[KeepTogether](Access.GroupLevel.KeepTogether.md)** property for a group set to Whole Group or With First Detail will be kept together by page or by column. Read/write **Byte**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **GrpKeepTogether**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Report** object.


## Remarks

The  **GrpKeepTogether** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Visual Basic**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Per Page|0|Groups are kept together by page.|
|Per Column|1|(Default) Groups are kept together by column.|
This property can be set only in report Design view.

You can use this property to specify whether all the data for a group will appear in the same column. For example, if you have a list of employees by department in a multiple-column format, you can use this property to keep all members of the same department in the same column.

The  **GrpKeepTogether** property setting has no effect if the **KeepTogether** property for a group is set to No.
