Then, click the object to which you want to apply a glow effect. Next, on the  **Format** tab, in the **Control Formatting** group, click **Shape Effects**, then click  **Glow** and choose a glow effect. Notice that the glow effects are indexed from left to right, and then top to bottom. So the first item, under No Glow, has the value 0.
