# CommandButton.PictureData Property (Access)

You can use the  **PictureData** property to copy the picture to another object that supports the **Picture** property. Read/write **Variant**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **PictureData**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **CommandButton** object.


## Remarks

The  **PictureData** property setting is the **PictureData** property of another control, form, or report.

You can use this property to display different background pictures in a form, depending on actions taken by the user. For example, you might open a Customers form using a different background picture depending on whether the form is opened for data entry or for browsing.

You can also use the  **PictureData** property together with the **Timer** event and the **TimerInterval** property to perform simple animation on a form.


## Example

The following example uses three image controls to animate a butterfly image across a form. The Hidden1 image control contains a picture of a butterfly with its wings up and the Hidden2 image control contains a picture of the same butterfly with its wings down. Both image controls have their  **Visible** property set to **False**. The **TimerInterval** property is set to 200. Each time the Timer event occurs, the picture in the image control Visible1 is changed by using the **PictureData** property of the hidden image controls, and the visible image control is moved 200 twips to the right. The visible image control is moved back to the left side of the form when its **Left** property value is greater than the width of the form stored in the public variable `gfrmWidth`. The value of  `gfrmWidth` is set to `Me.Width` in the form's open event.


```vb
Private Sub Form_Timer() 
 
 Static intPic As Integer 
 
 Select Case intPic 
 Case Is = 1 
 Me!Visible1.PictureData = Me!Hidden1.PictureData 
 Case Is = 2 
 Me!Visible1.PictureData = Me!Hidden2.PictureData 
 Case Else 
 End Select 
 
 If intPic = 2 Then intPic = 0 
 intPic = intPic + 1 
 If (Me!Visible1.Left > gfrmWidth) Then Me!Visible1.Left = 0 
 Me!Visible1.Left = Me!Visible1.Left + 200 
 
End Sub
```
