# Section.ForceNewPage Property (Access)

|After Section|2|The section immediately following the current section is printed at the top of a new page.|
|Before &; After|3|The current section is printed at the top of a new page, and the next section is printed at the top of a new page.|
Here are some examples of the  **ForceNewPage** property setting.
