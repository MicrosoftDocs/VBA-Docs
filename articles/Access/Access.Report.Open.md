# Report.Open Event (Access)

The **Open** occurs before a report is previewed or printed.


## Syntax

_expression_. **Open**(**_Cancel_**)

_expression_ A variable that represents a **Report** object.


### Parameters

|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Cancel_|Required|**Integer**|

### Return value

Nothing

## Remarks

For example, an **Open** macro or event procedure can open a custom dialog box in which the user enters the criteria to filter the set of records to display on a form or the date range to include for a report.

When you open a report based on an underlying query, Microsoft Access runs the **Open** macro or event procedure before it runs the underlying query for the report. This enables the user to specify criteria for the report before it opens ? for example, in a custom dialog box you display when the **Open** event occurs.

If your application can have more than one form loaded at a time, use the **Activate** and **Deactivate** events instead of the **Open** event to display and hide custom toolbars when the focus moves to a different form.

When the **Close** event occurs, you can open another window or request the user's name to make a log entry indicating who used the form or report.

If you're trying to decide whether to use the **Open** or **Load** event for your macro or event procedure, one significant difference is that the **Open** event can be canceled, but the **Load** event can't. For example, if you're dynamically building a record source for a form in an event procedure for the form's **Open** event, you can cancel opening the form if there are no records to display. Similarly, the **Unload** event can be canceled, but the **Close** event can't.


## Example

The following example shows how to use a Structured Query Language (SQL) statement to establish the data source of a report as it is opened.

```vb
Private Sub Report_Open(Cancel As Integer)

    On Error GoTo Error_Handler

    Me.Caption = "My Application"

    DoCmd.OpenForm FormName:="frmReportSelector_MemberList", _
    Windowmode:=acDialog

    'Cancel the report if "cancel" was selected on the dialog form.

    If Forms!frmReportSelector_MemberList!txtContinue = "no" Then
        Cancel = True
        GoTo Exit_Procedure
    End If
    Me.RecordSource = ReplaceWhereClause(Me.RecordSource, _
      Forms!frmReportSelector_MemberList!txtWhereClause)

Exit_Procedure:
    Exit Sub

Error_Handler:
    MsgBox Err.Number &; ": " &; Err.Description
    Resume Exit_Procedure
    Resume

End Sub
```
