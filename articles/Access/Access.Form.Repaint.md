# Form.Repaint Method (Access)

The  **Repaint** method completes any pending screen updates for a specified form. When performed on a form, the **Repaint** method also completes any pending recalculations of the form's controls.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Repaint**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Form** object.


### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks

Microsoft Access sometimes waits to complete pending screen updates until it finishes other tasks. With the  **Repaint** method, you can force immediate repainting of the controls on the specified form. You can use the **Repaint** method:


- When you change values in a number of fields. Unless you force a repaint, Microsoft Access might not display the changes immediately, especially if other fields, such as those in an expression in a calculated control, depend on values in the changed fields.
    
- When you want to make sure that a form displays data in all of its fields. For example, fields containing OLE objects often don't display their data immediately after you open a form.
    
This method doesn't cause a requery of the database, nor does it show new or changed records in the form's underlying record source. You can use the  **[Requery](Access.Form.Requery.md)** method to requery the source of data for the form or one of its controls.



|**Note**|
|:-----|
|<ul><li>Don't confuse the **Repaint** method with the [**Refresh**](Access.Form.Refresh.md) method, or with the **Refresh** command on the **Records** menu. The **Refresh** method and **Refresh** command show changes you or other users have made to the underlying record source for any of the currently displayed records in forms and datasheets. The **Repaint** method simply updates the screen when repainting has been delayed while Microsoft Access completes other tasks.</li><li>The **Repaint** method differs from the [**Echo**](Access.Application.Echo.md) method in that the **Repaint** method forces a single immediate repaint, while the Echo method turns repainting on or off.</li></ul>|   


## Example

The following example uses the  **Repaint** method to repaint a form when the form receives the focus:


```vb
Private Sub Form_Activate() 
    Me.Repaint 
End Sub
```
