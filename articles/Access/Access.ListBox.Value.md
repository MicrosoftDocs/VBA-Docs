# ListBox.Value Property (Access)

Determines or specifies which value or option in the list box is selected. Read/write  **Variant**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Value**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **ListBox** object.


## Remarks

Set the  **Value** property to the value in the bound column for the item selected in the list.

The  **Value** property returns or sets a control's default property, which is the property that is assumed when you don't explicitly specify a property name.


 **Note**   The **Value** property is not the same as the **DefaultValue** property, which specifies the value that a property is assigned when a new record is created.
