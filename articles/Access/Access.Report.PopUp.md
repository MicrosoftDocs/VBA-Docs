# Report.PopUp Property (Access)

Specifies whether a report opens as a pop-up window. Read/write  **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **PopUp**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Report** object.


## Remarks

The  **PopUp** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Visual Basic**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Yes|**True**|The report opens as a pop-up window. It remains on top of all other Microsoft Access windows.|
|No|**False**|(Default) The report isn't a pop-up window.|
The  **PopUp** property can be set only in Design view.

To specify the type of border you want on a pop-up window, use the  **BorderStyle** property. You typically set the **BorderStyle** property to Thin for pop-up windows.

Setting the  **PopUp** property to Yes makes the report a pop-up window only when you do one of the following:


- Open it in Form view from the Database window.
    
- Open it in Form view by using a macro or Visual Basic.
    
- Switch from Design view to Form view.
