<ul xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mtps="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/mtps" xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:mshelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:ddue="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><li><p><b>acLeftButton</b>  The bit mask for the left mouse button.

| _Shift_|Required|**Integer**|The state of the SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT keys when the button specified by the Button argument was pressed or released. If you need to test for the Shift argument, you can use one of the following intrinsic constants as bit masks:
<ul xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mtps="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/mtps" xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:mshelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:ddue="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><li><p><b>acShiftMask</b>  The bit mask for the SHIFT key.

## Remarks

 This event does not apply to a label attached to another control, such as the label for a text box. It applies only to "freestanding" labels. Pressing and releasing a mouse button in an attached label has the same effect as pressing and releasing the button in the associated control. The normal events for the control occur; no separate events occur for the attached label.

To run a macro or event procedure when these events occur, set the  **OnMouseMove** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

The  **MouseMove** event is generated continually as the mouse pointer moves over objects. Unless another object generates a mouse event, an object recognizes a **MouseMove** event whenever the mouse pointer is positioned within its borders.

To cause a  **MouseMove** event for a report to occur, press the mouse button in a blank area on the report. To cause a **MouseMove** event for a report section to occur, press the mouse button in a blank area of the report section.


 **Note**  

To run a macro or event procedure in response to pressing and releasing the mouse buttons, you use the  **MouseDown** and **MouseUp** events.
