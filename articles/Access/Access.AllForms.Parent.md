# AllForms.Parent Property (Access)

Returns the parent object for the specified object. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Parent**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **AllForms** object.


## Remarks

You can use the  **Parent** property to determine which form or report is currently the parent when you have a subform or subreport that has been inserted in multiple forms or reports.

For example, you might insert an OrderDetails subform into both a form and a report. The following example uses the  **Parent** property to refer to the OrderID field, which is present on the main form and report. You can enter this expression in a bound control on the subform.




```
=Parent!OrderID
```
