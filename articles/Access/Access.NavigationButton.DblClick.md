# NavigationButton.DblClick Event (Access)

The  **DblClick** event occurs when the user presses and releases the left mouse button twice over an object within the double-click time limit of the system.


## Syntax

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **NavigationButton** object.

| _Cancel_|Required|**Integer**||

### Return Value

## Remarks

On a form, the DblClick event occurs when the user double-clicks a blank area or record selector on the form. For a control, it occurs when the user double-clicks a control or its label in Form view. The  **DblClick** event occurs when the user double-clicks the form or control but before the result of the double-click action occurs (for example, before Microsoft Access selects the word that the insertion point is on in a text box).




- This event doesn't apply to check boxes, option buttons, or toggle buttons in an option group. It applies only to the option group itself.
    
- This event doesn't apply to a label attached to another control, such as the label for a text box. It applies only to "freestanding" labels. Double-clicking an attached label has the same effect as double-clicking the associated control. The normal events for the control occur, not any events for the attached label.
    


To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **OnDblClick** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

For controls, the result of double-clicking depends on the control. For example, double-clicking a word in a text box selects the entire word. Double-clicking a control containing an OLE object starts the application used to create the object, allowing it to be edited.

If the  **DblClick** event doesn't occur within the double-click time limit of the system, the form, form section, or control recognizes two **Click** events instead of a single **DblClick** event. The double-click time limit depends on the setting under **Double-Click Speed** on the **Buttons** tab of the **Mouse** option of Windows Control Panel.

By running a macro or an event procedure when the  **DblClick** event occurs, you can open a window or document when an icon is double-clicked.

Double-clicking a control causes both  **Click** and **DblClick** events to occur. If the control doesn't already have the focus when you double-click it, the **Enter** and **GotFocus** events for the control occur before the **Click** and **DblClick** events.

For objects that receive mouse events, the events occur in this order:

 **MouseDown** → **MouseUp** → **Click** → **DblClick**

When you double-click a command button, the following events occur in this order:

 **MouseDown** → **MouseUp** → **Click** → **DblClick** → **MouseUp** → **Click**

The second click may have no effect (for example, if the  **Click** macro or event procedure opens a modal dialog box in response to the first **Click** event). To prevent the second **Click** macro or event procedure from running, put a **CancelEvent** action in the **DblClick** macro or use the _Cancel_ argument in the **DblClick** event procedure. Note that, generally speaking, double-clicking a command button should be discouraged.

If you double-click any other control besides a command button, the second  **Click** event doesn't occur.


## Example

The following example shows how you can use a  **DblClick** event procedure to open a form that displays records from the table that is the row source of a combo box. When the user double-clicks the Salesperson combo box in an Orders form, the Employees form is displayed, showing the record for the employee selected in the combo box.

To try the example, add the following event procedure to a form named Orders that contains a combo box named EmployeeID. The combo box should have as its row source the same table that is the source for the Employees form (or a query based on that table).




```vb
Private Sub EmployeeID_DblClick(Cancel As Integer) 
 DoCmd.OpenForm "Employees", , , _ 
 "EmployeeID = Forms!Orders!EmployeeID" 
End Sub
```
