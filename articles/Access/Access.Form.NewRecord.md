# Form.NewRecord Property (Access)

You can use the  **NewRecord** property to determine whether the current record is a new record. Read-only **Integer**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **NewRecord**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Form** object.


## Remarks


 **Note**  The  **NewRecord** property is read-only in Form view and Datasheet view. It isn't available in Design view.

When a user has moved to a new record, the  **NewRecord** property setting will be **True** whether the user has started to edit the record or not.


## Example

The following example shows how to use the  **NewRecord** property to determine if the current record is a new record. The NewRecordMark procedure sets the current record to the variable `intnewrec`. If the record is new, a message is displayed notifying the user of this. You could run this procedure when the Current event for a form occurs.


```vb
Sub NewRecordMark(frm As Form) 
 Dim intnewrec As Integer 
 
 intnewrec = frm.NewRecord 
 If intnewrec = True Then 
 MsgBox "You're in a new record." _ 
 &; "@Do you want to add new data?" _ 
 &; "@If not, move to an existing record." 
 End If 
End Sub
```
