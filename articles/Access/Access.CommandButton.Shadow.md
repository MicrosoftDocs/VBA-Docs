To see the available shadow effects and apply a shadow through the user interface, first open the form or report in Layout view or Design view by right-clicking the form or report in the Navigation Pane, and then clicking the view you want. Then, click the object to which you want to apply a shadow effect. Next, on the  **Format** tab, in the **Control Formatting** group, click **Shape Effects**, then click  **Shadow** and choose a shadow effect. Notice that the shadow effects are indexed from left to right, and then top to bottom. So the first item, under No Shadow, has the value 0. Then, under Outer, the first row contains shadow effects with values from 1 to 3. The second row from 4 to 6, and so on.
