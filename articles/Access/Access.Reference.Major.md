# Reference.Major Property (Access)

The  **Major** property of a **[Reference](Access.Reference.md)** object returns a read-only **Long** value indicating the major version number of an application to which you have set a reference.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Major**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Reference** object.


## Remarks

The  **Major** property returns the value to the left of the decimal point in a version number. For example, if you've set a reference to an application whose version number is 2.5, the **Major** property returns 2.


## Example

The following example displays a message with information about all the references in the current project.


```vb
Dim r As Reference 
Dim strInfo As String 
 
For Each r In Application.References 
 strInfo = strInfo &; r.Name &; " " &; r.Major &; "." &; r.Minor &; vbCrLf 
Next 
 
 
MsgBox "Current References: " &; vbCrLf &; strInfo
```
