# Attachment.DblClick Event (Access)

The **DblClick** event occurs when the user presses and releases the left mouse button twice over an object within the double-click time limit of the system.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **DblClick**(*Cancel*)

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Attachment** object.


### Parameters


|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Cancel_|Required|Integer|The setting determines if the **DblClick** event occurs. Setting the _Cancel_ argument to **True** (1) cancels the **DblClick** event.|

## Remarks

On a form, the  **DblClick** event occurs when the user double-clicks a blank area or record selector on the form. For a control, it occurs when the user double-clicks a control or its label in Form view. The **DblClick** event occurs when the user double-clicks the form or control but before the result of the double-click action occurs (for example, before Microsoft Access selects the word that the insertion point is on in a text box).


- The  **DblClick** event applies only to forms, form sections, and controls on a form, not controls on a report.
    
- This event doesn't apply to a label attached to another control, such as the label for a text box. It applies only to "freestanding" labels. Double-clicking an attached label has the same effect as double-clicking the associated control. The normal events for the control occur, not any events for the attached label.
    
To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the **OnDblClick** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

For controls, the result of double-clicking depends on the control. For example, double-clicking a word in a text box selects the entire word. Double-clicking a control containing an OLE object starts the application used to create the object, allowing it to be edited.

If the  **DblClick** event doesn't occur within the double-click time limit of the system, the form, form section, or control recognizes two **Click** events instead of a single **DblClick** event. The double-click time limit depends on the setting under **Double-Click Speed** on the **Buttons** tab of the **Mouse** option of Windows Control Panel.

By running a macro or an event procedure when the  **DblClick** event occurs, you can open a window or document when an icon is double-clicked.

Double-clicking a control causes both  **Click** and **DblClick** events to occur. If the control doesn't already have the focus when you double-click it, the **Enter** and **GotFocus** events for the control occur before the **Click** and **DblClick** events.

For objects that receive mouse events, the events occur in this order:

 **MouseDown** → **MouseUp** → **Click** → **DblClick**

When you double-click a command button, the following events occur in this order:

 **MouseDown** → **MouseUp** → **Click** → **DblClick** → **MouseUp** → **Click**

The second click may have no effect (for example, if the  **Click** macro or event procedure opens a modal dialog box in response to the first **Click** event). To prevent the second **Click** macro or event procedure from running, put a **CancelEvent** action in the **DblClick** macro or use the _Cancel_ argument in the **DblClick** event procedure. Note that, generally speaking, double-clicking a command button should be discouraged.

If you double-click any other control besides a command button, the second  **Click** event doesn't occur.
