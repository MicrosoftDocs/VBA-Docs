# CommandButton.Click Event (Access)

The  **Click** event occurs when the user presses and then releases a mouse button over an object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Click**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **CommandButton** object.


## Remarks


- This event applies to a control containing a hyperlink.
    
To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **OnClick** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

For a control, this event occurs when the user:


- Clicks a control with the left mouse button. Clicking a control with the right or middle mouse button does not trigger this event.
    
- Clicks a control containing hyperlink data with the left mouse button. Clicking a control with the right or middle mouse button does not trigger this event. When the user moves the mouse pointer over a control containing hyperlink data, the mouse pointer changes to a "hand" icon. When the user clicks the mouse button, the hyperlink is activated, and then the  **Click** event occurs.
    
- Selects an item in a combo box or list box, either by pressing the arrow keys and then pressing the ENTER key or by clicking the mouse button.
    
- Presses SPACEBAR when a command button, check box, option button, or toggle button has the focus.
    
- Presses the ENTER key on a form that has a command button whose  **Default** property is set to Yes.
    
- Presses the ESC key on a form that has a command button whose  **Cancel** property is set to Yes.
    
- Presses a control's access key. For example, if a command button's  **Caption** property is set to &;Go, pressing ALT+G triggers the event.
    
For a command button only, Microsoft Access runs the macro or event procedure specified by the  **OnClick** property when the user chooses the command button by pressing the ENTER key or an access key. The macro or event procedure runs once. If you want the macro or event procedure to run repeatedly while the command button is pressed, set its **AutoRepeat** property to Yes. For other types of controls, you must click the control by using the mouse button to trigger the **Click** event.

The  **Click** event for a command button occurs when you choose the command button. In addition, if the command button doesn't already have the focus when you choose it, the **Enter** and **GotFocus** events for the command button occur before the **Click** event.

Double-clicking a control causes both the  **DblClick** and **Click** events to occur. For command buttons, double-clicking triggers the following events, in this order:

 **MouseDown** → **MouseUp** → **Click** → **DblClick** → **Click**

Typically, you attach a  **Click** event procedure or macro to a command button to carry out commands and command-like actions. For the other applicable controls, use this event to trigger actions in response to one of the occurrences discussed earlier in this topic.

You can use a  **CancelEvent** action in a DblClick macro to cancel the second **Click** event. For more information, see the DblClick event topic.

To distinguish between the left, right, and middle mouse buttons, use the  **MouseDown** and **MouseUp** events.
