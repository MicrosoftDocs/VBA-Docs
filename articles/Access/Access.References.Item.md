# References.Item Method (Access)

The  **Item** method returns a specific member of a collection either by position or by key. **Reference** object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Item**( ** _var_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **References** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _var_|Required|**Variant**|An expression that specifies the position of a member of the collection. If a numeric expression, the  _var_ argument must be a number from 1 to the value of the collection's **Count** property. If a string expression, the _var_ argument must be the name of a member of the collection.|

### Return Value

Reference


## Remarks

If the value provided for the  _var_ argument doesn't match any existing member of the collection, an error occurs.

The  **Item** method is the default member of the **References** collection, so you don't have to specify it explicitly. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent:




```vb
Debug.Print References(1).Name
```




```vb
Debug.Print References.Item(1).Name
```
