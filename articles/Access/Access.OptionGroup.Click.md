# OptionGroup.Click Event (Access)

The  **Click** event occurs when the user presses and then releases a mouse button over an object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Click**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **OptionGroup** object.


## Remarks


- This event doesn't apply to check boxes, option buttons, or toggle buttons in an option group. It applies only to the option group itself.
    
- This event applies to a control containing a hyperlink.
    
To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **OnClick** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

For a control, this event occurs when the user:


- Clicks a control with the left mouse button. Clicking a control with the right or middle mouse button does not trigger this event.
    
- Clicks a control containing hyperlink data with the left mouse button. Clicking a control with the right or middle mouse button does not trigger this event. When the user moves the mouse pointer over a control containing hyperlink data, the mouse pointer changes to a "hand" icon. When the user clicks the mouse button, the hyperlink is activated, and then the  **Click** event occurs.
    
- Selects an item in a combo box or list box, either by pressing the arrow keys and then pressing the ENTER key or by clicking the mouse button.
    
- Presses SPACEBAR when a command button, check box, option button, or toggle button has the focus.
    
- Presses the ENTER key on a form that has a command button whose  **Default** property is set to Yes.
    
- Presses the ESC key on a form that has a command button whose  **Cancel** property is set to Yes.
    
- Presses a control's access key. For example, if a command button's  **Caption** property is set to &;Go, pressing ALT+G triggers the event.
    
The  **Click** event for an option group occurs after you change the value of one of the controls in the option group by clicking the control. For example, if you click a toggle button, option button, or check box in an option group, the **Click** event for the option group occurs after the **BeforeUpdate** and **AfterUpdate** events for the option group.

Typically, you attach a  **Click** event procedure or macro to a command button to carry out commands and command-like actions. For the other applicable controls, use this event to trigger actions in response to one of the occurrences discussed earlier in this topic.

You can use a  **CancelEvent** action in a DblClick macro to cancel the second **Click** event. For more information, see the DblClick event topic.

To distinguish between the left, right, and middle mouse buttons, use the  **MouseDown** and **MouseUp** events.
