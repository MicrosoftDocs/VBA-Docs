# Screen.ActiveForm Property (Access)

You can use the  **ActiveForm** property together with the **[Screen](Access.Screen.md)** object to identify or refer to the form that has the focus. Read-only **Form** object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ActiveForm**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Screen** object.


## Remarks

This property setting contains a reference to the  **[Form](Access.Form.md)** object that has the focus at run time.

You can use the  **ActiveForm** property to refer to an active form together with one of its properties or methods. The following example displays the **Name** property setting of the active form.




```vb
Dim frmCurrentForm As Form 
Set frmCurrentForm = Screen.ActiveForm 
MsgBox "Current form is " &; frmCurrentForm.Name
```

If a subform has the focus,  **ActiveForm** refers to the main form. If no form or subform has the focus when you use the **ActiveForm** property, an error occurs.
