# Form.AllowFilters Property (Access)

You can use the  **AllowFilters** property to specify whether records in a form can be filtered. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AllowFilters**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Form** object.


## Remarks

Filters are commonly used to view a temporary subset of the records in a database. When you use a filter, you apply criteria to display only records that meet specific conditions. In an Employees form, for example, you can use a filter to display only records of employees with over 5 years of service. You can also use a filter to restrict access to records containing sensitive information, such as financial or medical data.




 **Note**  Setting the  **AllowFilters** property to No does not affect the **[Filter](Access.Form.Filter(property).md)**, **[FilterOn](Access.Form.FilterOn.md)**, **[ServerFilter](Access.Form.ServerFilter.md)**, or **[ServerFilterByForm](Access.Form.ServerFilterByForm.md)** properties. You can still use these properties to set and remove filters. You can also still use the following actions or methods to apply and remove filters.



|**Actions**|**Methods**|
|:-----|:-----|
|ApplyFilter|**[ApplyFilter](Access.DoCmd.ApplyFilter.md)**|
|OpenForm|**[OpenForm](Access.DoCmd.OpenForm.md)**|
|ShowAllRecords|**[ShowAllRecords](Access.DoCmd.ShowAllRecords.md)**|
