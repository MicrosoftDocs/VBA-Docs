# WebBrowserControl.ScrollLeft Property (Access)

Gets or sets the distance, in pixels, between the left edge of the  **WebBrowser** object and the leftmost portion of the content currently visible in the control. Read/write **Long**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ScrollLeft**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **WebBrowserControl** object.


## Remarks

This property value equals the current horizontal offset of the content within the scrollable range. Although you can set this property to any value, if you assign a value less than 0, the property is set to 0. If you assign a value greater than the maximum value, the property is set to the maximum value.

This property is always 0 for objects that do not have scroll bars. For these objects, setting the property has no effect.
