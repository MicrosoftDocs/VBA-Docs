# ComboBox.Recordset Property (Access)

Returns or sets the ADO  **Recordset** or DAO **[Recordset](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/9774232C-E6DA-175B-FC7F-ED2AB7908FA0%28Office.15%29.aspx)** object representing the record source for the specified object. Read/write **Object**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Recordset**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

The  **Recordset** property returns the recordset object that provides the data being browsed in a form, report, list box control, or combo box control. If a form is based on a query, for example, referring to the **Recordset** property is the equivalent of cloning a **Recordset** object by using the same query. However, unlike using the **RecordsetClone** property, changing which record is current in the recordset returned by the form's **Recordset** property also sets the current record of the form.

The read/write behavior of the  **Recordset** property is determined by the type of recordset (ADO or DAO) and the type of data (Access or SQL) contained in the recordset identified by the property.



|**Recordset type**|**Based on SQL data**|**Based on data stored by the Access database engine**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**ADO**|Read/Write|Read/Write|
|**DAO**|N/A|Read/Write|
The following example opens a form, opens a recordset, and then binds the form to the recordset by setting the form's  **Recordset** property to the newly created **Recordset** object.




```vb
Global rstSuppliers As ADODB.Recordset 
Sub MakeRW()      
    DoCmd.OpenForm "Suppliers" 
    Set rstSuppliers = New ADODB.Recordset 
    rstSuppliers.CursorLocation = adUseClient 
    rstSuppliers.Open "Select * From Suppliers", _ 
         CurrentProject.Connection, adOpenKeyset, adLockOptimistic      
    Set Forms("Suppliers").Recordset = rstSuppliers 
End Sub
```

Use the  **Recordset** property:


- To use methods with the  **Recordset** object that aren't directly supported on forms. For example, you can use the **Recordset** property with the ADO **Find** or DAO **Find** methods in a custom dialog for finding a record.
    
- To wrap a transaction (which can be rolled back) around a set of edits that affect multiple forms.
    
Changing a form's  **Recordset** property may also change the **RecordSource**, **RecordsetType**, and **RecordLocks** properties. Also, some data-related properties may be overridden, for example, the **Filter**, **FilterOn**, **OrderBy**, and **OrderByOn** properties.

Calling the  **Requery** method of a form's recordset (for example, `Forms(0).Recordset.Requery`) can cause the form to become unbound. To refresh the data in a form bound to a recordset, set the  **RecordSource** property of the form to itself ( `Forms(0).RecordSource = Forms(0).RecordSource`).


- To bind multiple forms to a common data set. This allows synchronization of multiple forms. For example,
    



```vb
   Set Me.Recordset = Forms!Form1.Recordset
```

When a form is bound to a recordset, an error occurs if you use the Filter by Form command.


## Example

The following example uses the  **Recordset** property to create a new copy of the **Recordset** object from the current form and then prints the names of the fields in the Debug window.


```vb
Sub Print_Field_Names() 
    Dim rst As DAO.Recordset, intI As Integer 
    Dim fld As Field 
 
    Set rst = Me.Recordset 
    For Each fld in rst.Fields 
        ' Print field names. 
        Debug.Print fld.Name 
    Next 
End Sub
```

The next example uses the  **Recordset** property and the **Recordset** object to synchronize a recordset with the form's current record. When a company name is selected from a combo box, the **FindFirst** method is used to locate the record for that company, causing the form to display the found record.




```vb
Sub SupplierID_AfterUpdate() 
    Dim rst As DAO.Recordset 
    Dim strSearchName As String 
 
    Set rst = Me.Recordset 
    strSearchName = CStr(Me!SupplierID) 
    rst.FindFirst "SupplierID = " &; strSearchName 
    If rst.NoMatch Then 
        MsgBox "Record not found" 
    End If 
    rst.Close 
End Sub
```

The following code helps to determine what type of recordset is returned by the  **Recordset** property under different conditions.




```vb
Sub CheckRSType() 
    Dim rs as Object 
 
    Set rs=Forms(0).Recordset 
    If TypeOf rs Is DAO.Recordset Then 
        MsgBox "DAO Recordset" 
    ElseIf TypeOf rs is ADODB.Recordset Then 
        MsgBox "ADO Recordset" 
    End If 
End Sub
```
