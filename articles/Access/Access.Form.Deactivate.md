# Form.Deactivate Event (Access)

The  **Deactivate** event occurs when a form loses the focus to a Table, Query, Form, Report, Macro, or Module window, or to the Database window.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Deactivate**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Form** object.


### Return Value

## Remarks

When you switch between two open forms, the  **Deactivate** event occurs for the form being switched from, and the **Activate** event occurs for the form being switched to. If the forms contain no visible, enabled controls, the **LostFocus** event occurs for the first form before the **Deactivate** event, and the **GotFocus** event occurs for the second form after the **Activate** event.

When you first open a form, the following events occur in this order:

 **Open** → **Load** → **Resize** → **Activate** → **Current**

When you close a form, the following events occur in this order:

 **Unload** → **Deactivate** → **Close**
