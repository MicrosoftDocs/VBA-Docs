# Report.PrintCount Property (Access)

You can use the  **PrintCount** property to identify the number of times the **OnPrint** property has been evaluated for the current section of a report. Read/write **Integer**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **PrintCount**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Report** object.


## Remarks

You can use this property only in a macro or an [event procedure](set-properties-by-using-visual-basic.md)specified by a section's  **OnPrint** property setting.

Microsoft Access increments the  **PrintCount** property each time the **OnPrint** property setting is evaluated for the current section. As the next section is printed, Microsoft Access resets the **PrintCount** property to 0.

This property isn't available in report Design view.

The  **PrintCount** property is incremented, for example, when the **[KeepTogether](Access.Section.KeepTogether.md)** property is set to No for the current section and the section is printed on more than one page. If you print a report containing order information, you might keep a running total of the order amounts.


## Example

The following example shows how you can use the  **PrintCount** property to make sure the value in the OrderAmount control is added only once to the running total.

 RunningTotal can be a public variable or the name of an unbound control that is incremented each time a section is printed.




```vb
Private Sub Detail_Format(Cancel As Integer, FormatCount As Integer) 
 If PrintCount = 1 Then 
 RunningTotal = RunningTotal + OrderAmount 
 End If 
End Sub
```
