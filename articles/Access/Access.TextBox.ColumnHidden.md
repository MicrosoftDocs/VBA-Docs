# TextBox.ColumnHidden Property (Access)

You can use the  **ColumnHidden** property to show or hide a specified column in Datasheet view. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ColumnHidden**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **TextBox** object.


## Remarks

For example, you might want to hide a CustomerAddress field that's too wide so you can view the CustomerName and PhoneNumber fields.


 **Note**  The  **ColumnHidden** property applies to all fields in Datasheet view and to form controls when the form is in Datasheet view.

Hiding a column with the  **ColumnHidden** property in Datasheet view doesn't hide fields from the same column in Form view. Similarly, setting a control's **Visible** property to **False** in Form view doesn't hide the corresponding column in Datasheet view.


 **Note**  To set or change this property for a table or query by using Visual Basic, you must use a column's  **Properties** collection. For details on using the **Properties** collection, see **Properties**.

You can display a field in a query even though the column for the field is hidden in table Datasheet view. You can use values from a hidden column as the criteria for a filter even though the column remains hidden after the filter is applied.

Setting a field's  **ColumnWidth** property to 0, or resizing the field to a zero width in Datasheet view, causes Microsoft Access to set the corresponding **ColumnHidden** property to **True**. Unhiding a column restores the **ColumnWidth** property to the value it had before the field was hidden.


 **Note**  The  **ColumnHidden** property is not available in Design view.


## Example

The following example hides the ProductID field in Datasheet view of the Products form.


```vb
Forms!Products!ProductID.ColumnHidden = -1
```

The next example also hides the ProductID field in Datasheet view of the Products table.




```vb
Public Sub SetColumnHidden() 
 
 Dim dbs As DAO.Database 
 Dim fld As DAO.Field 
 Dim prp As DAO.Property 
 Const conErrPropertyNotFound = 3270 
 
 ' Turn off error trapping. 
 On Error Resume Next 
 
 Set dbs = CurrentDb 
 
 ' Set field property. 
 Set fld = dbs.TableDefs!Products.Fields!ProductID 
 fld.Properties("ColumnHidden") = True 
 
 ' Error may have occurred when value was set. 
 If Err.Number <> 0 Then 
 If Err.Number <> conErrPropertyNotFound Then 
 On Error GoTo 0 
 MsgBox "Couldn't set property 'ColumnHidden' " &; _ 
 "on field '" &; fld.Name &; "'", vbCritical 
 Else 
 On Error GoTo 0 
 Set prp = fld.CreateProperty("ColumnHidden", dbLong, True) 
 fld.Properties.Append prp 
 End If 
 End If 
 
 Set prp = Nothing 
 Set fld = Nothing 
 Set dbs = Nothing 
 
End Sub
```
