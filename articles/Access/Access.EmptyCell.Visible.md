# EmptyCell.Visible Property (Access)

Returns or sets whether the object is visible. Read/write  **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Visible**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **EmptyCell** object.


## Remarks

To hide an object when printing, use the  **DisplayWhen** property.

You can use the  **Visible** property to hide a control on a form or report by including the property in a macro or event procedure that runs when the **Current** event occurs. For example, you can show or hide a congratulatory message next to a salesperson's monthly sales total in a sales report, depending on the sales total.
