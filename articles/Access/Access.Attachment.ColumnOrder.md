# Attachment.ColumnOrder Property (Access)

You can use the  **ColumnOrder** property to specify the order of the columns in Datasheet view. Read/write **Integer**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ColumnOrder**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Attachment** object.


## Remarks


 **Note**  The  **ColumnOrder** property isn't available in Design view.

The  **ColumnOrder** property applies to all fields in Datasheet view and to form controls when the form is in Datasheet view.

In other views, the property setting is 0 unless you explicitly change the order of one or more fields in Datasheet view (either by dragging the fields to new positions or by changing their  **ColumnOrder** property settings). Fields to the right of the moved field's new position will have a property setting of 0 in views other than Datasheet view.

The order of the fields in Datasheet view doesn't affect the order of the fields in table Design view or Form view.
