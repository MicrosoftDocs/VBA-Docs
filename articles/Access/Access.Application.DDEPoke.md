# Application.DDEPoke Method (Access)

You can use the  **DDEPoke** statement to supply text data from a client application to a server application over an open dynamic data exchange (DDE) channel.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **DDEPoke**( ** _ChanNum_**, ** _Item_**, ** _Data_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _ChanNum_|Required|**Variant**| A channel number, an integer returned by the **[DDEInitiate](Access.Application.DDEInitiate.md)** function.|
| _Item_|Required|**String**|The name of a data item recognized by the application specified by the  **DDEInitiate** function. Check the application's documentation for a list of possible items.|
| _Data_|Required|**String**|The data to be supplied to the other application.|

## Remarks

For example, if you have an open DDE channel between Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel, you can use the  **DDEPoke** statement to transfer text from a Microsoft Access database to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. In this example, Microsoft Access acts as the client application, and Microsoft Excel acts as the server application.

The value of the  _item_ argument depends on the application and topic specified when the channel indicated by the _channum_ argument is opened. For example, the _item_ argument may be a range of cells in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

The string contained in the  _data_ argument must be an alphanumeric text string. No other formats are supported. For example, the _data_ argument could be a number to fill a cell in a specified range in an Excel worksheet.

If the  _channum_ argument isn't an integer corresponding to an open channel or if the other application doesn't recognize or accept the specified data, a run-time error occurs.

If you need to manipulate another application's objects from Microsoft Access, you may want to consider using Automation.
