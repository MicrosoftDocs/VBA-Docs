# Report.OpenArgs Property (Access)

Determines the string expression specified by the  _OpenArgs_ argument of the **OpenReport** method that opened a Report. Read/write **Variant**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **OpenArgs**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Report** object.


## Remarks

This property is available only by using a macro or by using Visual Basic with the  **OpenReport** method of the **DoCmd** object. This property setting is read-only in all views.

To use the  **OpenArgs** property, open a report by using the **OpenReport** method of the **DoCmd** object and set the _OpenArgs_ argument to the desired string expression. The **OpenArgs** property setting can then be used in code for the report, such as in an **Open** event procedure. You can also refer to the property setting in a macro, such as an Open macro, or an expression, such as an expression that sets the **ControlSource** property for a control on the form.
