# Application.CurrentUser Method (Access)

You can use the  **CurrentUser** method to return the name of the current user of the database. .


## Syntax

 _expression_. **CurrentUser**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.

## Remarks

For example, use the  **CurrentUser** method in a procedure that keeps track of the users who modify the database.

The  **CurrentUser** method returns a string that contains the name of the current user account.

If you haven't established a security-enabled workgroup, the  **CurrentUser** method returns the name of the default user account, Admin. The Admin user account gives the user full permissions to all database objects.

If you have enabled workgroup security, then the  **CurrentUser** method returns the name of the current user account. For user accounts other than Admin, you can specify permissions that restrict the users' access to database objects.


## Example

The following example obtains the name of the current user and displays it in a dialog box.
