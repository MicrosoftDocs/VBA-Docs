# Report.Cycle Property (Access)

You can use the  **Cycle** property to specify what happens when you press the TAB key and the focus is in the last control on a report. Read/write **Byte**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Cycle**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Report** object.


## Remarks

The  **Cycle** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Visual Basic**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|All Records|0|(Default) Pressing the TAB key from the last control on a report moves the focus to the first control in the tab order in the next record.|
|Current Record|1|Pressing the TAB key from the last control on a record moves the focus to the first control in the tab order in the same record.|
|Current Page|2|Pressing the TAB key from the last control on a page moves the focus back to the first control in the tab order on the page.|
You can set the  **Cycle** property by using the report's property sheet, a macro, or Visual Basic.

You can set the  **Cycle** property in any view.

When you press the TAB key on a report, the focus moves through the controls on the report according to each control's place in the tab order.

The  **Cycle** property only controls the TAB key behavior on the report where the property is set. If a subreport control is in the tab order, once the subreport control receives the focus, the **Cycle** property setting for the subreport determines what happens when you press the TAB key.

To move the focus outside a subreport control, press CTRL+TAB.
