# Attachment.Dirty Event (Access)

The  **Dirty** event occurs when the content of the specified control changes.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Dirty**( ** _Cancel_**, )

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Attachment** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Cancel_|Required|**Integer**|The setting determines if the  **Dirty** event occurs. Setting the _Cancel_ argument to **True** (?1) cancels the **Dirty** event.|

## Remarks

Examples of this event include entering a character directly in the text box or combo box or changing the control's  **Text** property setting by using a macro or Visual Basic.


- Modifying a record within a form by using a macro or Visual Basic doesn't trigger this event. You must type the data directly into the record or set the control's  **Text** property.
    
- This event applies only to bound forms, not an unbound form or report.
    
To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **OnDirty** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

Canceling the  **Dirty** event will cause the changes to the current record to be rolled back. It is equivalent to pressing the ESC key.
