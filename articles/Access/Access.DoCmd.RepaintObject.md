# DoCmd.RepaintObject Method (Access)

The  **RepaintObject** method carries out the RepaintObject action in Visual Basic.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **RepaintObject**( ** _ObjectType_**, ** _ObjectName_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **DoCmd** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _ObjectType_|Optional|**AcObjectType**|A  **[AcObjectType](Access.AcObjectType.md)** constant that specifies the type of object to repaint.|
| _ObjectName_|Optional|**Variant**|A string expression that's the valid name of an object of the type selected by the  _objecttype_ argument.|

## Remarks

You can use the  **RepaintObject** method to complete any pending screen updates for a specified database object or for the active database object, if none is specified. Such updates include any pending recalculations for the object's controls.

Using the  **RepaintObject** method with no arguments (the default constant, **acDefault**, is assumed for the _objecttype_ argument) repaints the active window.

The  **RepaintObject** method of the **DoCmd** object was added to provide backwards compatibility for running the **RepaintObject** method in Visual Basic code in Microsoft Access 95. If you want to repaint a form, it's recommended that you use the existing **Repaint** method of the **Form** object instead.


## Example

The following example repaints the table Customers:


```vb
DoCmd.RepaintObject acTable, "Customers"
```
