# Attachment.ColumnHidden Property (Access)

You can use the  **ColumnHidden** property to show or hide a specified column in Datasheet view. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ColumnHidden**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Attachment** object.


## Remarks


 **Note**  The  **ColumnHidden** property applies to all fields in Datasheet view and to form controls when the form is in Datasheet view.

Hiding a column with the  **ColumnHidden** property in Datasheet view doesn't hide fields from the same column in Form view. Similarly, setting a control's **Visible** property to **False** in Form view doesn't hide the corresponding column in Datasheet view.


 **Note**  The  **ColumnHidden** property is not available in Design view.
