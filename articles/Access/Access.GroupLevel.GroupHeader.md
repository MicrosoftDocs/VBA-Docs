# GroupLevel.GroupHeader Property (Access)

You can use the  **GroupHeader** property to create a group header for a selected field or expression in a report. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **GroupHeader**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **GroupLevel** object.


## Remarks

You can use group headers and footers to label or summarize data in a group of records. For example, if you set the  **GroupHeader** property to Yes for the Categories field, each group of products will begin with its category name.


 **Note**  You can't set or refer to these properties directly in Visual Basic. To create a group header or footer for a field or expression in Visual Basic, use the  **[CreateGroupLevel](Access.Application.CreateGroupLevel.md)** method.

To set the grouping properties —  **[GroupOn](Access.GroupLevel.GroupOn.md)**, **[GroupInterval](Access.GroupLevel.GroupInterval.md)**, and **[KeepTogether](Access.GroupLevel.KeepTogether.md)** — to other than their default values, you must first set the **GroupHeader** or **GroupFooter** property or both to Yes for the selected field or expression.
