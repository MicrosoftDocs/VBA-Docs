# Form.ViewsAllowed Property (Access)

You can use the  **ViewsAllowed** property to specify whether users can switch between Datasheet view and Form view by clicking the **Form View** or **Datasheet View** command on the **View** menu or by clicking the arrow next to the **View** button and clicking **Form View** or **Datasheet View**. Read/write **Byte**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ViewsAllowed**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Form** object.


## Remarks

The  **ViewsAllowed** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|0|(Default) Users can switch between Form view and Datasheet view.|
|1|Users can't switch to Datasheet view from Form view.|
|2|Users can't switch to Form view from Datasheet view.|
The views displayed in the  **View** button list and on the **View** menu depend on the setting of the **ViewsAllowed** property. For example, if the **ViewsAllowed** property is set to Datasheet, **Form View** is disabled in the **View** button list and on the **View** menu.

The combination of these properties creates the following conditions.



|**DefaultView**|**ViewsAllowed**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Single, Continuous Forms, or Datasheet|Both|Users can switch between Form view and Datasheet view.|
|Single or Continuous Forms|Form|Users can't switch from Form view to Datasheet view.|
