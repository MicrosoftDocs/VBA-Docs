# TabControl.Value Property (Access)

Determines or specifies the selected  **[Page](Access.Page.md)** object. Read/write **Variant**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Value**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **TabControl** object.


## Remarks

The  **Value** property of a tab control contains the index number of the current **Page** object. There is one **Page** object for each tab in a tab control. The first **Page** object always has an index number of 0, the second has an index number of 1, and so on.

The  **Value** property returns or sets a control's default property, which is the property that is assumed when you don't explicitly specify a property name.


 **Note**   The **Value** property is not the same as the **DefaultValue** property, which specifies the value that a property is assigned when a new record is created.
