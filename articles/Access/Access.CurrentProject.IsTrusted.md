# CurrentProject.IsTrusted Property (Access)

Gets whether or not macros and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code have been enabled in the current project. Read-only  **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **IsTrusted**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **CurrentProject** object.


## Example

The following example shows how to use the  **IsTrusted** property in a macro to determine whether the database has been opened with trust enabled. If trust has been enabled, the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) subroutine **Init** is called. Otherwise, the use is notified that the database has been opened in disabled mode.
