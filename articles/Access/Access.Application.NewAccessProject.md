## Remarks

The  **NewAccessProject** method enables you to create a new Access project from within Microsoft Access or another application through Automation, formally called OLE Automation. For example, you can use the **NewAccessProject** method from Microsoft Excel to create a new Access project in the Access window. Once you have created an instance of Microsoft Access from another application, you must also create a new Access project. This Access project opens in the Microsoft Access window.

If the Access project identified by  _projname_ already exists, an error occurs.

The new Access project is opened under the Admin user account .




 **Note**   To open an Access database, use the **[NewCurrentDatabase](Access.Application.NewCurrentDatabase.md)** method of the **[Application](Access.Application.md)** object.
