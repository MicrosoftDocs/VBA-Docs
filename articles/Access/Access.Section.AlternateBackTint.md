# Section.AlternateBackTint Property (Access)

Gets or sets the tint applied to the theme color in the  **AlternateBackColor** property of the section. Read/write **Single**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AlternateBackTint**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Section** object.


## Remarks

The  **AlternateBackTint** property contains a numeric expression that can be used to lighten the theme color in the **AlternateBackColor** property. The default value of the **AlternateBackTint** property is 100, which is neutral, and does not change the theme color. To lighten the color, first determine the percentage by which to lighten from 1 to 100, then subtract that value as a whole number from 100 and use the remainder. For example, to lighten the theme color tint by 75%, subtract 75 from 100 and use the remainder, which is 25.

This property is not surfaced in the property sheet.
