## Remarks

Assign the return value of the  **LoadPicture** method to the **Picture** property of an ActiveX control to dynamically load a graphic into the control. The following example loads a bitmap into a control called OLECustomControl on an Orders form:


```vb
Set Forms!Orders!OLECustomControl.Picture = _ 
 LoadPicture("Stars.bmp")
```
