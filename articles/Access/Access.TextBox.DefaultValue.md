# TextBox.DefaultValue Property (Access)

Specifies a value that is automatically entered in a field when a new record is created. For example, in an Addresses table you can set the default value for the City field to New York. When users add a record to the table, they can either accept this value or enter the name of a different city. Read/write  **String**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **DefaultValue**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **TextBox** object.


## Remarks

The  **DefaultValue** property applies to all table fields except those fields with the data type of AutoNumber or OLE Object.

The  **DefaultValue** property specifies text or an expression that's automatically entered in a control or field when a new record is created. For example, if you set the **DefaultValue** property for a text box control to `=Now()`, the control displays the current date and time. The maximum length for a  **DefaultValue** property setting is 255 characters.

In Visual Basic, use a string expression to set the value of this property. For example, the following code sets the  **DefaultValue** property for a text box control named PaymentMethod to "Cash"




```vb
Forms!frmInvoice!PaymentMethod.DefaultValue = """Cash"""
```


 **Note**  To set this property for a field by using Visual Basic, use the ADO  **DefaultValue** property or the DAO **DefaultValue** property.

The  **DefaultValue** property is applied only when you add a new record. If you change the **DefaultValue** property, the change isn't automatically applied to existing records.

If you set the  **DefaultValue** property for a form control that's bound to a field that also has a **DefaultValue** property setting defined in the table, the control setting overrides the table setting.

If you create a control by dragging a field from the field list, the field's  **DefaultValue** property setting, as defined in the table, is applied to the control on the form although the control's **DefaultValue** property setting will remain blank.

One control can provide the default value for another control. For example, if you set the  **DefaultValue** property for a control to the following expression, the control's default value is set to the **DefaultValue** property setting for the `txtShipTo` control.




```
=Forms!frmInvoice!txtShipTo
```

If the controls are on the same form, the control that's the source of the default value must appear earlier in the tab order than the control containing the expression.
