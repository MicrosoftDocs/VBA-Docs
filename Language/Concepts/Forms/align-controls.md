# Align controls

1. Select the controls to align.
    
2. Select the [dominant control](../../Glossary/glossary-vba.md#dominant-control).
    
3. From the **[Format](../../reference/user-interface-help/format-menu.md)** menu, choose **Align**.
    
4. From the cascading menu, choose one of the following to align the specified part of each selected control with the same part of the dominant control:
    
   - **Lefts**, to align the left edge.
    
   - **Centers**, to align the center of each control. This means a vertical line drawn at the center of the dominant control would contain the center of every selected control.
    
   - **Rights**, to align the right edge.
    
   - **Tops**, to align the top.
    
   - **Middles**, to align the center of each control. This means a horizontal line drawn at the center of the dominant control would also contain the center of every selected control.
    
   - **Bottoms**, to align the bottom.
    
   - **To Grid**, to align the upper left corner of each selected control with its nearest grid point. Note that this option is not based on the position of the dominant control.
    
> [!NOTE] 
> Each command on the menu has a small picture that shows how the controls will be aligned.
