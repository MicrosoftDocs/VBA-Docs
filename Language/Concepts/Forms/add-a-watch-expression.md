# Add a Watch Expression

A watch expression is an expression you define to be monitored in the  **Watch** window. When your application enters[break mode](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#break-mode), the watch expressions you selected appear in the  **Watch** window where you can observe their values.

 **To add a watch expression**




1. On the  **Debug** menu, click **Add Watch**. The **Add Watch** dialog box is displayed.
    
2. If an [expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#expression) is already selected in the **Code** window, it is automatically displayed in the **Expression** box. If no expression is displayed, enter the expression you want to evaluate. The expression can be a[variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable), a [property](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property), a function call, or any other valid expression.
    
3. Select a [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module) or[procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) context in the **Context** group to select the range for which the expression will be evaluated.
    
     **Note**  Select the narrowest [scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope) that fits your needs. Selecting all procedures or all modules can slow down module execution considerably, since the expression is evaluated after execution of each statement. If you select a specific procedure for a context, execution is affected only while the procedure is in the list of active procedure calls. Choose **Call Stack** from the **View** menu to display the list of active procedures.
4. Select an option in the  **Watch Type** group to define how the system responds to the watch expression.
    
    
    
      - To display the value of the watch expression, click  **Watch Expression**.
    
  - To stop execution if the expression evaluates to  **True**, click **Break When Value is True**.
    
  - To stop execution when the value of the expression changes, click  **Break When Value Changes**.
    

    
    
5. Click  **OK**.
