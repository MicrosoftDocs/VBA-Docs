# What is a ToolTip?

A ToolTip is a short description, usually just a few words, that appears when the user holds the mouse pointer briefly over a control or another part of the user interface without clicking. You can customize ToolTips for controls and for the **[Toolbox](../../reference/user-interface-help/toolbox.md)**.

The default value for a new control that is copied from a form to the Toolbox is **New** followed by the control type. For example, the default ToolTip for a customized CommandButton (such as OK) is **New CommandButton**. If a control has no associated ToolTip, **Unknown** is the default value.

> [!NOTE] 
> The ToolTip is information provided by Microsoft Forms to form developers in design mode. Each control has a property, **ControlTipText**, that allows form developers to give a **ToolTip** to end users while the application is running.
