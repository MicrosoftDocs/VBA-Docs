# What is a TabStrip?

A  **TabStrip** is a control that contains a[collection](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#collection) of one or more tabs.

Each  **Tab** of a **TabStrip** is a separate object that users can select. Visually, a **TabStrip** also includes a client area that all the tabs in the **TabStrip** share.

By default, a  **TabStrip** includes two pages, called Tab1 and Tab2. Each of these is a **Tab** object, and together they represent the **Tabs** collection of the **TabStrip**. If you add more pages, they become part of the same **Tabs** collection.
