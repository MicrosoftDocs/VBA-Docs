# What is a MultiPage?

A **[MultiPage](../../reference/user-interface-help/multipage-control.md)** is a control that contains a [collection](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#collection) of one or more pages.

Each **[Page](../../reference/user-interface-help/page-object.md)** of a **MultiPage** is a form that contains its own controls, and as such, can have a unique layout. Typically, the pages in a **MultiPage** have tabs so that the user can select the individual pages.

By default, a **MultiPage** includes two pages, called Page1 and Page2. Each of these is a **Page** object, and together they represent the **Pages** collection of the **MultiPage**. If you add more pages, they become part of the same **[Pages](../../reference/user-interface-help/pages-collection-microsoft-forms.md)** collection.
