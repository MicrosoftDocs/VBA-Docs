# Customize a Toolbox icon

1. Right-click the icon in the **[Toolbox](../../reference/user-interface-help/toolbox.md)**.
    
2. From the shortcut menu, choose **Customize**.
    
3. Do one of the following:
    
   - To change the ToolTip, enter the new text for the ToolTip.
    
   - To edit the icon, choose **Edit Picture**. Choose the color you want to use and choose the pixel in the image where you want to apply that color.
    
   - To assign a new bitmap, choose **Load Picture**. Identify the file that contains the bitmap that you want to use as the icon. If you attempt to load a picture that is larger than an icon, an error occurs.
