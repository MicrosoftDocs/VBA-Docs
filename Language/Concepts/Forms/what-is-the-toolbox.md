# What is the Toolbox?

The **[Toolbox](../../reference/user-interface-help/toolbox.md)** identifies the different controls that you can add to a form, **[Frame](../../reference/user-interface-help/frame-control.md)**, or **[Page](../../reference/user-interface-help/page-object.md)**.

You can customize the Toolbox in many ways, including the following:

- Add pages to the Toolbox.
    
- Move controls from one page to another.
    
- Rename pages.
    
- Add other controls, including ActiveX controls, to the Toolbox.
    
- Copy customized controls from the form into the Toolbox.
    
- For example, **OK** and **Cancel** buttons are special cases of a **[CommandButton](../../reference/user-interface-help/commandbutton-control.md)**. If you add **OK** and **Cancel** templates to the Toolbox, you can quickly add them to other forms.
