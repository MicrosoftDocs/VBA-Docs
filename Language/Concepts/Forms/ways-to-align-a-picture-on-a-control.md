# Align a picture on a control

The **[Picture](../../reference/user-interface-help/picture-property.md)** property assigns a bitmap or other picture to a control. After you assign the picture to the control, you can do any of the following to align the picture on the control:

- Use the **[PictureAlignment](../../reference/user-interface-help/picturealignment-property.md)** property to center the picture within the **[Image](../../reference/user-interface-help/image-control.md)** or align any corner of the picture with the corresponding corner of the **Image**.
    
- Use the **[PictureSizeMode](../../reference/user-interface-help/picturesizemode-property.md)** property to clip, stretch, or zoom the picture within the **Image**. Stretching can distort the picture, but zooming will not.
    
- Use the **[PictureTiling](../../reference/user-interface-help/picturetiling-property.md)** property to display multiple copies of the picture within the **Image**.
