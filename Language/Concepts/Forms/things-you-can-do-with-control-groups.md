# Things you can do with control groups

A group is two or more controls on a form that you treat as a single unit. You can include any control on the form in a group. After controls belong to a group, you can work with the entire group, or you can select a single object.

Microsoft Forms provides many ways to work with groups and the controls in a group. After you select a group, you can do any of the following:

- Size all controls in the group at the same time. For more information, see [Size all the controls in a group](size-all-the-controls-in-a-group.md).
    
- Break up the group so that each control is independent of the others. For more information, see [Break up a control group](break-up-a-control-group.md).
    
- Display the group's shortcut menu, which provides quick access to commands that affect the group. For more information, see [Display a group's shortcut menu](display-a-group-s-shortcut-menu.md).
    
- Select a single control within the group without breaking up the group, which lets you change property settings of that control without affecting any other control in the group. For more information, see [Select a control within a group](select-a-control-within-a-group.md).
