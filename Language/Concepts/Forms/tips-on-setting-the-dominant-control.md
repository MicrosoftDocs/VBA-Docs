# Tips on setting the dominant control

You can set the [dominant control](../../Glossary/glossary-vba.md#dominant-control) in one of the following ways when selecting multiple controls:

- **SHIFT+CLICK**: The dominant control is the first control you select by using SHIFT+CLICK.
    
- **CTRL+CLICK**: The dominant control is the last control you select by using CTRL+CLICK.
    
- **Select Objects pointer on the [Toolbox](../../reference/user-interface-help/toolbox.md)**: The dominant control is nearest the mouse pointer when you begin drawing the rectangle over the controls that you want to select.  

If you press CTRL+CLICK twice on a selected control, that control becomes the dominant control.
