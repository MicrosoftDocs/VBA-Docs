# Assign a custom Help topic to a control

This procedure assumes that you have created a custom Help file and associated it with your project. The procedure for associating a Help file with a project depends on your project environment.

1. Select a control for which you have written a custom Help topic.
    
2. In the **Properties** window, select the **[HelpContextID](../../reference/user-interface-help/helpcontextid-property.md)** property.
    
3. Enter the context ID of the appropriate topic from your custom Help file.
