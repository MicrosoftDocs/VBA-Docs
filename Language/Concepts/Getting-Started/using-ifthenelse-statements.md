# Using If...Then...Else Statements

You can use the  **If...Then...Else** statement to run a specific[statement](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#statement) or a block of statements, depending on the value of a condition. **If...Then...Else** statements can be nested to as many levels as you need. However, for readability, you may want to use a **Select Case** statement rather than multiple levels of nested **If...Then...Else** statements.


## Running Statements if a Condition is True

To run only one statement when a condition is  **True**, use the single-line syntax of the **If...Then...Else** statement. The following example shows the single-line syntax, omitting the **Else**[keyword](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#keyword):


```vb
Sub FixDate() 
 myDate = #2/13/95# 
 If myDate < Now Then myDate = Now 
End Sub
```

To run more than one line of code, you must use the multiple-line syntax. This syntax includes the  **End If** statement, as shown in the following example:




```vb
Sub AlertUser(value as Long) 
 If value = 0 Then 
 AlertLabel.ForeColor = "Red" 
 AlertLabel.Font.Bold = True 
 AlertLabel.Font.Italic = True 
 End If 
End Sub
```


## Running Certain Statements if a Condition is True and Running Others if It's False

Use an  **If...Then...Else** statement to define two blocks of executable statements: one block runs if the condition is **True**, the other block runs if the condition is **False**.


```vb
Sub AlertUser(value as Long) 
 If value = 0 Then 
 AlertLabel.ForeColor = vbRed 
 AlertLabel.Font.Bold = True 
 AlertLabel.Font.Italic = True 
 Else 
 AlertLabel.Forecolor = vbBlack 
 AlertLabel.Font.Bold = False 
 AlertLabel.Font.Italic = False 
 End If 
End Sub
```


## Testing a Second Condition if the First Condition is False

You can add  **ElseIf** statements to an **If...Then...Else** statement to test a second condition if the first condition is **False**. For example, the following function procedure computes a bonus based on job classification. The statement following the **Else** statement runs if the conditions in all of the **If** and **ElseIf** statements are **False**.


```vb
Function Bonus(performance, salary) 
 If performance = 1 Then 
 Bonus = salary * 0.1 
 ElseIf performance = 2 Then 
 Bonus = salary * 0.09 
 ElseIf performance = 3 Then 
 Bonus = salary * 0.07 
 Else 
 Bonus = 0 
 End If 
End Function
```
