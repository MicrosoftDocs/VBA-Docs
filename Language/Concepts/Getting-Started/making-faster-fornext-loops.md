# Making Faster For...Next Loops

Integers use less memory than the [Variant data type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Variant-data-type) and are slightly faster to update. However, this difference is only noticeable if you perform many thousands of operations. For example:


```vb
Dim CountFaster As Integer    ' First case, use Integer. 
For CountFaster = 0 to 32766     
Next CountFaster 
 
Dim CountSlower As Variant    ' Second case, use Variant. 
For CountSlower = 0 to 32766 
Next CountSlower 

```


The first case above takes slightly less time to run than the second case. However, if  `CountFaster` exceeds 32,767, an error occurs. To fix this, you can change `CountFaster` to the [Long data type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Long-data-type), which accepts a wider range of integers. In general, the smaller the [data type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#data-type), the less time it takes to update. Variants are slightly slower than their equivalent data type.
