# Using the Add-In Manager

Use the **[Add-In Manager](../../reference/user-interface-help/add-in-manager-dialog-box.md)** dialog box to load or unload an add-in. If you close only the visible portions of an add-in—by double-clicking its system menu or by clicking its close button, for example—its forms disappear from the screen, but the add-in is still present in memory. 

The add-in object itself will always stay resident in memory until the add-in is disconnected through the **Add-In Manager** dialog box.
