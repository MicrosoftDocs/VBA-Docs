# The project file 'item1' contains invalid key 'item2'.

This error has the following causes and solutions:



- The Visual Basic project (.vbp) file contains a key that Visual Basic doesn't recognize. The file may be corrupt. Install a backup copy of the specified file or modify the file using a text editor to correct the error. Modifying a Visual Basic file in an editor other than Visual Basic may corrupt the file. This is recommended only for advanced users.
