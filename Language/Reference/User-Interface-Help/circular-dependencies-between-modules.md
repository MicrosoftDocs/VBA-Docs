# Circular dependencies between modules

Circular references between [modules](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module), [constants](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#constant), and [user-defined types](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#user-defined-type) aren't allowed. This error has the following cause and solution:



- A user-defined type or constant in one module references a user-defined type or constant in a second module, which in turn references another user-defined type or constant in the first module. Remove the dependent references.
