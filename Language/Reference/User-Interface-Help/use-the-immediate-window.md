# Use the Immediate window

The [Immediate window](immediate-window.md) displays information resulting from debugging statements in your code or from commands typed directly into the window.

**To display the Immediate window**

- From the **[View](view-menu.md)** menu, choose Immediate window (CTRL+G).
    
**To execute code in the Immediate window**

1. Type a line of code in the Immediate window.
    
2. Press ENTER to execute the statement.
    

Use the Immediate window to:

- Test problematic or newly written code.
    
- Query or change the value of a [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) while running an application. While execution is halted, assign the variable a new value as you would in code.
    
- Query or change a property value while running an application.
    
- Call [procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) as you would in code.
    
- View debugging output while the program is running.
    

> [!NOTE] 
> Immediate window statements are executed in a context—that is, as if they are entered in a specific [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module).

If you need help on syntax for functions, statements, [properties](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property), or [methods](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#method) while working in the Immediate window, select the [keyword](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#keyword), the property name, or the method name, and press F1.
