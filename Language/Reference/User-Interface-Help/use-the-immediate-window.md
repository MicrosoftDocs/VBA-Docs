# Use the Immediate Window

The  **Immediate** window displays information resulting from debugging statements in your code or from commands typed directly into the window.

 **To display the Immediate window**




- From the  **View** menu, choose **Immediate** window (CTRL+G)
    

 **To execute code in the Immediate window**


1. Type a line of code in the  **Immediate** window.
    
2. Press ENTER to execute the statement.
    

Use the  **Immediate** window to:


- Test problematic or newly written code.
    
- Query or change the value of a [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) while running an application. While execution is halted, assign the variable a new value as you would in code.
    
- Query or change a property value while running an application.
    
- Call [procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) as you would in code.
    
- View debugging output while the program is running.
    
     **Note**   **Immediate** window statements are executed in a context â€” that is, as if they are entered in a specific[module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module).

If you need help on syntax for functions, statements, [properties](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property), or [methods](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#method) while working in the **Immediate** window, select the[keyword](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#keyword), the property name, or the method name, and press F1.
