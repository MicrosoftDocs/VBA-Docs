# The file 'item' is out of date. This program requires a later version (Error 368)

An [ActiveX control](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#activex-control) was found to be out of date. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The number of [properties](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) in the current version of the ActiveX control don't match the expected number of properties.
    
    Replace the ActiveX control with a later version.
