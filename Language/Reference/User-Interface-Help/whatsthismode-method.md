# WhatsThisMode Method



Causes the mouse pointer to change to the  **What's This** pointer and prepares the application to display Help on a selected object. This method exists on the Macintosh, but there is no pointer functionality.

## Syntax

_object_. **WhatsThisMode**
The  _object_ placeholder represents an[object expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-expression) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list. If _object_ is omitted, the **UserForm** with the[focus](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#focus) is assumed to be _object_.

## Remarks

Executing the  **WhatsThisMode** method places the application in the same state as clicking the **What's This** button on the title bar. The mouse pointer changes to the **What's This** pointer. When the user clicks an object, the **WhatsThisHelpID** property of the clicked object is used to invoke the context-sensitive Help.

## Example

The following example changes the mouse pointer to the  **What's This** (question mark) pointer when the user clicks the **UserForm**. If neither the **WhatsThisHelp** or the **WhatsThisButton** property is set to **True** in the **Properties** window, the following invocation has no effect.


```vb
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
' Turn mouse pointer to What's This question mark.
    WhatsThisMode
End Sub
```
