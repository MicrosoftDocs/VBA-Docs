# Operation not allowed in DLL

Not all Visual Basic statements are allowed within a [dynamic-link library (DLL)](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#dynamic-link-library-(DLL)). This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to create a DLL from a [class](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#class) that contains a statement that can't be executed from a DLL.
    
    Check your class and remove any statements that can't be executed within a DLL, for example, the  **End statement**.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
