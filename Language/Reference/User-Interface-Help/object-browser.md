Displays the [classes](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#classe), properties, methods, events, and constants available from [object libraries](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-librarie) and the[procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) in your project. You can use it to find and use objects you create, as well as objects from other applications.

You can get Help for the  **Object** **Browser** by searching for Object Browser in Help.


## Window Elements Project/Library Box

Displays the currently referenced libraries for the active project. You can add libraries in the  **References** dialog box. <All Libraries> allows all of the libraries to be displayed at one time.

 **Search Text Box**

Contains the string that you want to use in your search. You can type or choose the string you want. The Search Text box contains the last 4 search strings that you entered until you close the project. You can use the standard Visual Basic wildcards when typing a string.

If you want to search for a whole word, you can use the  **Find** **Whole** **Word** **Only** command from the shortcut menu.

Allows you to repeat your original selections in the Classes and Members of lists each time you click it, until you exhaust the list of selections.


![Copy to clipboard button](../../../images/but_copy_ZA01201582.gif) **Copy to Clipboard Button**

Copies the current selection in the Members of list or the Details pane text to the Clipboard. You can then paste the selection into your code.


![View definition button](../../../images/viewdef_ZA01201805.gif) **View Definition Button**

Initiates a search of the libraries for the class or property, method, event or constant that matches the string you typed in the Search Text box, and opens the  **Search** **Results** pane with the appropriate list of information.

 **Classes List**

Displays all of the available classes in the library or project selected in the Project/Libraries box. If there is code written for a class, that class appears in bold. The list always begins with <globals>, a list of globally accessible members.

If you select a Class and do not specify a member, you will get the default member if one is available. The default member is identified by an asterisk (*) or by the default [icon](icons-used-in-the-object-browser-and-code-windows.md) specific to the member.

 **Members of List**

Displays the elements of the class selected in the  **Classes** pane by group and then alphabetically within each group. Methods, properties, events, or constants that have code written for them appear bold. You can change the order of this list with the **Group** **Members** command on the **Object** **Browser** shortcut menu.

 **Details Pane**

Shows the definition of the member. The  **Details** pane contains a jump to the class or library to which the element belongs. Some members have jumps to their parent class. For example, if the text in the **Details** pane states that Command1 is declared as a command button type, clicking on command button takes you to the Command Button class.

You can copy or drag text from the  **Details** pane to the **Code** window.

- Classes box and the Members of box.
    
- Search Results list and the Classes and Members of boxes.
    
- Classes and Members of boxes and the  **Details** pane.
