# LongPtr Data Type

 **LongPtr** ([Long](long-data-type.md) integer on 32-bit systems, [LongLong](longlong-data-type.md) integer on 64-bit systems) variables are stored as signed 32-bit (4-byte) numbers ranging in value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 on 32-bit systems; and signed 64-bit (8-byte) numbers ranging in value from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 on 64-bit systems.


 **Note**  [LongPtr](longptr-data-type.md) is not a true data type because it transforms to a [Long](long-data-type.md) in 32-bit environments, or a [LongLong](longlong-data-type.md) in 64-bit environments. Using **LongPtr** enables writing portable code that can run in both 32-bit and 64-bit environments. Use **LongPtr** for pointers and handles.
