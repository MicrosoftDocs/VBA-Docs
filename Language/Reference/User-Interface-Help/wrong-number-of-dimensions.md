# Wrong number of dimensions

You must reference an [array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array) with indexes corresponding to the same number of dimensions as appear in the array's[declaration](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#declaration). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You referred to an array with a different number of dimensions than it actually contains. For example, referring to an array as  `X(2,4)` (an array with two dimensions) when it has been defined as `Dim X(5)` (an array with one), generates this error. Check the declaration of the array and, in the reference, include one index for each dimension in the declaration.
