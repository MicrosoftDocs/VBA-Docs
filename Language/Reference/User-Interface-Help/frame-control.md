# Frame control

Creates a functional and visual [control group](../../Glossary/glossary-vba.md#control-group).

## Remarks

All option buttons in a **Frame** are mutually exclusive, so you can use the **Frame** to create an option group. 

You can also use a **Frame** to group controls with closely related contents. For example, in an application that processes customer orders, you might use a **Frame** to group the name, address, and account number of customers.

You can also use a **Frame** to create a group of toggle buttons, but the toggle buttons are not mutually exclusive.

The default event for a **Frame** is the Click event.
