# Variable not defined

You use the  **Option Explicit** statement to protect your[modules](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module) from having undeclared[variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) and to eliminate the possibility of inadvertently creating new variables when typographical errors occur. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You used an  **Option Explicit** statement to require the explicit declaration of variables, but you used a variable without declaring it. Explicitly declare the variable, or change the spelling of the variable to match that of the intended variable.
