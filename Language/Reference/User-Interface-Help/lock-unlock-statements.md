# Lock, Unlock Statements

Controls access by other processes to all or part of a file opened using the  **Open** statement.

## Syntax

**Lock** [ **#** ] _filenumber_ [, _recordrange_ ]
 **. . .**

 **Unlock** [ **#** ] _filenumber_ [, _recordrange_ ]
The  **Lock** and **Unlock** statement syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _filenumber_|Required. Any valid [file number](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#file-number).|
| _recordrange_|Optional. The range of records to lock or unlock.|

 **Settings**
The  _recordrange_[argument](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) settings are:
 _recnumber_ | [ _start_ ] **To**_end_


|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _recnumber_|Record number (**Random** mode files) or byte number (**Binary** mode files) at which locking or unlocking begins.|
| _start_|Number of the first record or byte to lock or unlock.|
| _end_|Number of the last record or byte to lock or unlock.|

## Remarks

The  **Lock** and **Unlock** statements are used in environments where several processes might need access to the same file.
 **Lock** and **Unlock** statements are always used in pairs. The arguments to **Lock** and **Unlock** must match exactly.
The first record or byte in a file is at position 1, the second record or byte is at position 2, and so on. If you specify just one record, then only that record is locked or unlocked. If you specify a range of records and omit a starting record ( _start_ ), all records from the first record to the end of the range ( _end_ ) are locked or unlocked. Using **Lock** without _recnumber_ locks the entire file; using **Unlock** without _recnumber_ unlocks the entire file.
If the file has been opened for sequential input or output,  **Lock** and **Unlock** affect the entire file, regardless of the range specified by _start_ and _end_.

 **Important**  Be sure to remove all locks with an  **Unlock** statement before closing a file or quitting your program. Failure to remove locks produces unpredictable results.


## Example

This example illustrates the use of the  **Lock** and **Unlock** statements. While a record is being modified, access by other processes to the record is denied. This example assumes that `TESTFILE` is a file containing five records of the user-defined type is a file containing five records of the user-defined type `Record`.


```vb
Type Record    ' Define user-defined type. 
    ID As Integer 
    Name As String * 20 
End Type 
 
Dim MyRecord As Record, RecordNumber    ' Declare variables. 
' Open sample file for random access. 
Open "TESTFILE" For Random Shared As #1 Len = Len(MyRecord) 
RecordNumber = 4    ' Define record number. 
Lock #1, RecordNumber    ' Lock record. 
Get #1, RecordNumber, MyRecord    ' Read record. 
MyRecord.ID = 234    ' Modify record. 
MyRecord.Name = "John Smith" 
Put #1, RecordNumber, MyRecord    ' Write modified record. 
Unlock #1, RecordNumber    ' Unlock current record. 
Close #1    ' Close file. 

```
