# Cyclic reference of projects not allowed

Circular references to [projects](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) aren't allowed. For example, if `MyProj` references `YourProj`, then  `YourProj` (or a project that references `YourProj`) can't reference references  `YourProj`, then  `YourProj` (or a project that references `YourProj`) can't reference  `MyProj`. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to add a reference to a project that is already part of the project. Remove the circular reference or references.
