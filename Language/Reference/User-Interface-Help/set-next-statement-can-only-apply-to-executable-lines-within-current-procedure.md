# Set Next Statement can only apply to executable lines within current procedure.

You can choose the  **Set Next Statement** command to indicate where a suspended program should begin when execution is continued. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- When you chose the command, the cursor was on a line that didn't contain an executable statement. Place the cursor on a line with an executable statement and try again. [Declarations](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#declaration), [line labels](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#line-label), and [comments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#comment) aren't executable, so lines with only declarations, labels, and comments can't be the targets of the **Set Next Statement** command.
    
- When you chose the command, the cursor was on a line outside the currently executing [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure).
    
    Place the cursor on a line within the currently executing procedure.
