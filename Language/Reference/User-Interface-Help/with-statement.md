# With Statement

Executes a series of [statements](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#statement) on a single object or a [user-defined type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#user-defined-type).

## Syntax

**With**_object_
[ _statements_ ]

 **End With**
The  **With** statement syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. Name of an object or a user-defined type.|
| _statements_|Optional. One or more statements to be executed on  _object_.|

## Remarks

The  **With** statement allows you to perform a series of statements on a specified object without requalifying the name of the object. For example, to change a number of different[properties](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) on a single object, place the property assignment statements within the **With** control structure, referring to the object once instead of referring to it with each property assignment. The following example illustrates use of the **With** statement to assign values to several properties of the same object.



```vb
With MyLabel 
 .Height = 2000 
 .Width = 2000 
 .Caption = "This is MyLabel" 
End With 

```


 **Note**  Once a  **With** block is entered, _object_ can't be changed. As a result, you can't use a single **With** statement to affect a number of different objects.

You can nest  **With** statements by placing one **With** block within another. However, because members of outer **With** blocks are masked within the inner **With** blocks, you must provide a fully qualified object reference in an inner **With** block to any member of an object in an outer **With** block.

 **Note**  In general, it's recommended that you don't jump into or out of  **With** blocks. If statements in a **With** block are executed, but either the **With** or **End With** statement is not executed, a temporary variable containing a reference to the object remains in memory until you exit the procedure.


## Example

This example uses the  **With** statement to execute a series of statements on a single object. The object and its properties are generic names used for illustration purposes only.


```vb
With MyObject 
 .Height = 100 ' Same as MyObject.Height = 100. 
 .Caption = "Hello World" ' Same as MyObject.Caption = "Hello World". 
 With .Font 
  .Color = Red ' Same as MyObject.Font.Color = Red. 
  .Bold = True ' Same as MyObject.Font.Bold = True. 
 End With
End With
```
