# Can't place conditional breakpoint on an array

An [array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array) has no single value associated with it. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to set a conditional [breakpoint](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#breakpoint) (sometimes called a watchpoint) that would suspend program execution when the value of a whole array changed.
    
    Set the conditional breakpoint on a specific element of the array.
