# External name not defined

You can indicate external names by enclosing them in brackets (**[ ]**). This error has the following cause and solution:



- The [identifier](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#identifier) specified within brackets has no meaning to the [host application](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#host-application).
    
    Check the spelling of the name to be sure it's consistent with that expected by the host.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
