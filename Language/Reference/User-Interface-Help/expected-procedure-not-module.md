# Expected procedure, not module

There is no [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) by this name in the current[scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope), but there is a [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module) by this name. You can call a procedure, but not a module. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The name of a module is used as a procedure call. Check the spelling of the procedure name, and make sure the procedure you are trying to call isn't private to another module.
