# Count Property (Visual Basic for Applications)



Returns a [Long](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md) (long integer) containing the number of objects in a[collection](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#collection). Read-only.

## Example

This example uses the  **Collection** object's **Count** property to specify how many iterations are required to remove all the elements of the collection called `MyClasses`. When collections are numerically indexed, the base is 1 by default. Since collections are reindexed automatically when a removal is made, the following code removes the first member on each iteration.


```vb
Dim Num, MyClasses
For Num = 1 To MyClasses. Count    ' Remove name from the collection.
    MyClasses.Remove 1    ' Default collection numeric indexes
Next    ' begin at 1.
```
