# Partition Function



Returns a  **Variant** (**String**) indicating where a number occurs within a calculated series of ranges.

## Syntax

**Partition( _number_,** **_start_,** **_stop_,** **_interval_ )**
The  **Partition** function syntax has these[named arguments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#named-argument):


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**_number_**|Required. Whole number that you want to evaluate against the ranges.|
|**_start_**|Required. Whole number that is the start of the overall range of numbers. The number can't be less than 0.|
|**_stop_**|Required. Whole number that is the end of the overall range of numbers. The number can't be equal to or less than  **_start_**.|

## Remarks

The  **Partition** function identifies the particular range in which **_number_** falls and returns a **Variant** (**String**) describing that range. The **Partition** function is most useful in queries. You can create a select query that shows how many orders fall within various ranges, for example, order values from 1 to 1000, 1001 to 2000, and so on.
The following table shows how the ranges are determined using three sets of  **_start_**, **_stop_**, and **_interval_** parts. The First Range and Last Range columns show what **Partition** returns. The ranges are represented by _lowervalue_: _uppervalue_, where the low end ( _lowervalue_ ) of the range is separated from the high end ( _uppervalue_ ) of the range with a colon (**:**).


|**_start_**|**_stop_**|**_interval_**|**Before First**|**First Range**|**Last Range**|**After Last**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|0|99|5|" :-1"|" 0: 4"|" 95: 99"|" 100: "|
|20|199|10|" : 19"|" 20: 29"|" 190: 199"|" 200: "|
|100|1010|20|" : 99"|" 100: 119"|" 1000: 1010"|" 1011: "|

In the table shown above, the third line shows the result when  **_start_** and **_stop_** define a set of numbers that can't be evenly divided by **_interval_**. The last range extends to **_stop_** (11 numbers) even though **_interval_** is 20.
If necessary,  **Partition** returns a range with enough leading spaces so that there are the same number of characters to the left and right of the colon as there are characters in **_stop_**, plus one. This ensures that if you use **Partition** with other numbers, the resulting text will be handled properly during any subsequent sort operation.
If  **_interval_** is 1, the range is **_number:number_**, regardless of the **_start_** and **_stop_** arguments. For example, if **_interval_** is 1, **_number_** is 100 and **_stop_** is 1000, **Partition** returns " 100: 100".
If any of the parts is [Null](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Null),  **Partition** returns a **Null**.

## Example

This example assumes you have an Orders table that contains a Freight field. It creates a select procedure that counts the number of orders for which freight cost falls into each of several ranges. The  **Partition** function is used first to establish these ranges, then the SQL Count function counts the number of orders in each range. In this example, the arguments to the **Partition** function are _start_ = 0, _stop_ = 500, _interval_ = 50. The first range would therefore be 0:49, and so on up to 500.


```sql
SELECT DISTINCTROW Partition([freight],0, 500, 50) AS Range,
Count(Orders.Freight) AS Count
FROM Orders
GROUP BY Partition([freight],0,500,50);


```
