# Array argument must be ByRef

[Arrays](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array) declared with **Dim**, **ReDim**, or **Static** can't be passed **ByVal**. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to pass a whole array  **ByVal**. An individual element of an array can be passed **ByVal** ([by value](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#by-value)), but a whole array must be passed  **ByRef** ([by reference](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#by-reference)). Note that  **ByRef** is the default. If you must pass an array **ByVal** to prevent changes to the array's elements from being propagated back to the caller, you can pass the array[argument](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) in its own set of parentheses, or you can place it into a **Variant**, and then pass the **Variant** to the **ByVal** parameter, as follows:
    
```vb
Dim MyVar As Variant 
MyVar = OldArray() 

  ```
