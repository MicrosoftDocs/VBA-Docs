# Invalid attribute in Sub, Function, or Property

Some attributes are invalid within [procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure). This error has the following cause and solution:



- A  **Public** or **Private** attribute appears within the body of a procedure definition. Remove the attribute from the procedure. To give the[variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) wider[scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope), move the declaration to [module level](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module-level). Variables declared within procedures are always  **Private**.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
