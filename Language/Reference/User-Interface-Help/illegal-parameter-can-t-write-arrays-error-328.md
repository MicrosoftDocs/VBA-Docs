# Illegal parameter. Can't write arrays (Error 328)

An illegal [parameter](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#parameter) was passed to the method. This error has the following cause and solution:



- In the  **WriteProperties** event of your User Control, you tried to do a **PropBag.WriteProperty** X, where X is an[array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array). This isn't supported.
    
    You must write out each element of the array individually.
