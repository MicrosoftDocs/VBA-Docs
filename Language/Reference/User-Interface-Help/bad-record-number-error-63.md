# Bad record number (Error 63)

An error occurred during the attempted file access. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The record number in a  **Put** or **Get** statement is less than or equal to zero. Check the calculations used in generating the record number. Make sure that the[variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) containing the record number or used in calculating record numbers are spelled correctly. A misspelled variable name is implicitly declared and initialized to zero, unless you have properly placed **Option Explicit** in the[module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module).
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
