# Invalid procedure name
There are restrictions in procedure-naming beyond the rules for naming [identifiers](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#identifier). This error has the following cause and solution:


- [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure)[host application](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#host-application)
    
    Choose another name for the procedure.
    
- Your procedure name is that of a restricted keyword, exceeds 255 characters, or doesn't begin with a letter. Choose a different name for the procedure.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
