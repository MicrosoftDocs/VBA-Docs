# Activate, Deactivate events

The **Activate** event occurs when an object becomes the active window. The **Deactivate** event occurs when an object is no longer the active window.

## Syntax

**Private Sub** _object_**_Activate( )**<br/>
**Private Sub** _object_**_Deactivate( )**

The _object_ placeholder represents an [object expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-expression) that evaluates to an object in the **Applies To** list.

## Remarks

An object can become active by using the **[Show](show-method.md)** method in code.

The **Activate** event can occur only when an object is visible. A **[UserForm](userform-window.md)** loaded with **[Load](load-statement.md)** isn't visible unless you use the **Show** method.

The **Activate** and **Deactivate** events occur only when you move the [focus](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#focus) within an application. Moving the focus to or from an object in another application doesn't trigger either event.

The **Deactivate** event doesn't occur when unloading an object.

## Example

The following code uses two **UserForms**: UserForm1 and UserForm2. Copy these procedures into the UserForm1 module, and then add UserForm2. UserForm1's caption is created in its **Activate** event procedure. When the user clicks the client area of UserForm1, UserForm2 is loaded and shown triggering UserForm1's **Deactivate** event, changing their captions.


```vb
' Activate event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Activate()
    UserForm1.Caption = "Click my client area"
End Sub

' Click event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    Load UserForm2
    UserForm2.StartUpPosition = 3
    UserForm2.Show
End Sub

' Deactivate event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Deactivate()
    UserForm1.Caption = "I just lost the focus!"
    UserForm2.Caption = "Focus just left UserForm1 and came to me"
End Sub
```
