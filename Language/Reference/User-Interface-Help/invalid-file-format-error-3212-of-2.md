Consult the documentation for the component to determine the proper format for disk file data and whether the component provides support for converting from one format to another.
    
- You tried to save component data to a file, but the format of the data was incompatible with the format of the file. Consult the documentation for the component to determine whether it provides support for converting from one format to another.
