# Use the Properties Window

The  **Properties** window lists the[design-time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#design-time)[properties](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) for selected objects and their current settings. You can change these properties at design time. When you select multiple controls, the **Properties** window contains a list of the properties common to all the selected controls.

 **To navigate the Properties window**




1. From the  **View** menu of the Visual Basic Editor, choose **Properties** window (F4).
    
2. Select the object whose properties you want to display. You can either use the mouse to select the object or use the  **Project Explorer** to choose from a list.
    
3. Click the  **Alphabetic** tab to display properties in alphabetic order, or click the **Categorized** tab to display object properties by category.
    

 **To change a property's value**


1. Select the property in the left column.
    
2. Change the property's value in the right column.
    
     **Note**  You can enter a property's value in the right column. For those properties that have a predefined set of values, click the value and then select one from the values displayed in the list box.
