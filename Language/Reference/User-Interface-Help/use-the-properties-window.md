# Use the Properties window

The [Properties window](properties-window.md) lists the [design-time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#design-time) [properties](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) for selected objects and their current settings. You can change these properties at design time. When you select multiple controls, the Properties window contains a list of the properties common to all the selected controls.

**To navigate the Properties window**

1. From the **View** menu of the Visual Basic Editor, choose Properties window (F4).
    
2. Select the object whose properties you want to display. You can either use the mouse to select the object or use the **Project Explorer** to choose from a list.
    
3. Click the **Alphabetic** tab to display properties in alphabetic order, or choose the **Categorized** tab to display object properties by category.
    
**To change a property's value**

1. Select the property in the left column.
    
2. Change the property's value in the right column.
    
   > [!NOTE] 
   > You can enter a property's value in the right column. For those properties that have a predefined set of values, choose the value and then select one from the values displayed in the list box.
