# Accelerator Property



Sets or retrieves the [accelerator key](../../Glossary/glossary-vba.md#accelerator-key) for a control.

## Syntax

_object_. **Accelerator** [= _String_ ]
The  **Accelerator** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _String_|Optional. The character to use as the accelerator key.|

## Remarks

To designate an accelerator key, enter a single character for the  **Accelerator** property. You can set **Accelerator** in the control's property sheet or in code. If the value of this property contains more than one character, the first character in the string becomes the value of **Accelerator**.
When an accelerator key is used, there is no visual feedback (other than [focus](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#focus)) to indicate that the control initiated the Click event. For example, if the accelerator key applies to a  **CommandButton**, the user will not see the button pressed in the interface. The button receives the focus, however, when the user presses the accelerator key.
If the accelerator applies to a  **Label**, the control following the **Label** in the[tab order](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#tab-order), rather than the  **Label** itself, receives the focus.
