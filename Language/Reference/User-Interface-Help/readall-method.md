# ReadAll method

Reads an entire **TextStream** file and returns the resulting string.

## Syntax

_object_.**ReadAll**

The _object_ is always the name of a **[TextStream](textstream-object.md)** object.

## Remarks

For large files, using the **ReadAll** method wastes memory resources. Other techniques should be used to input a file, such as reading a file line-by-line.
