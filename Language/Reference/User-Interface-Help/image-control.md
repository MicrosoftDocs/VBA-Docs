# Image control

Displays a picture on a form.

## Remarks

The **Image** control lets you display a picture as part of the data in a form. For example, you might use an **Image** to display employee photographs in a personnel form.

The **Image** lets you crop, size, or zoom a picture, but does not allow you to edit the contents of the picture. For example, you cannot use the **Image** to change the colors in the picture, to make the picture [transparent](../../Glossary/glossary-vba.md#transparent), or to refine the image of the picture. You must use image editing software for these purposes.

The **Image** supports the following file formats:

- *.bmp    
- *.cur    
- *.gif    
- *.ico    
- *.jpg    
- *.wmf
    
> [!NOTE] 
> You can also display a picture on a **[Label](label-control.md)**. However, a **Label** does not let you crop, size, or zoom the picture.

The default event for the **Image** is the Click event.
