# DeleteSetting Statement

Deletes a section or key setting from an application's entry in the Windows [registry](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#registry) or (on the Macintosh) information in the application's initialization file.

## Syntax

**DeleteSetting  _appname_,** **_section_** [ **,** **_key_** ]

The  **DeleteSetting** statement syntax has these[named arguments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#named-argument):


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**_appname_**|Required. [String expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#String-expression) containing the name of the application or[project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) to which the section or key setting applies. On the Macintosh, this is the filename of the initialization file in the Preferences folder in the System folder.|
|**_section_**|Required. String expression containing the name of the section where the key setting is being deleted. If only  **_appname_** and **_section_** are provided, the specified section is deleted along with all related key settings.|
|**_key_**|Optional. String expression containing the name of the key setting being deleted.|

## Remarks

If all [arguments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) are provided, the specified setting is deleted. A run-time error occurs if you attempt to use the **DeleteSetting** statement on a non-existent section or key setting.

## Example

The following example first uses the  **SaveSetting** statement to make entries in the Windows registry (or .ini file on 16-bit Windows platforms) for the application, and then uses the **DeleteSetting** statement to remove them. Because no **_key_** argument is specified, the whole section is deleted, including the section name and all its keys.


```vb
' Place some settings in the registry. 
SaveSetting appname := "MyApp", section := "Startup", _ 
 key := "Top", setting := 75 
SaveSetting "MyApp","Startup", "Left", 50 
' Remove section and all its settings from registry. 
DeleteSetting "MyApp", "Startup"
```
