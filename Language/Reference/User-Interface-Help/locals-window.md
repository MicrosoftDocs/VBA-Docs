# Locals Window


![Locals window](../../../images/local_ZA01201622.gif)



Automatically displays all of the declared variables in the current procedure and their values.

When the  **Locals** window is visible, it is automatically updated every time there is a change from Run to[Break mode](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#break-mode) or you navigate in the stack display.

You can:


- Resize the column headers by dragging the border to the right or the left.
    
- Close the window by clicking the Close box. If the Close box is not visible, double-click the  **Title** bar to make the Close box visible, then click it.
