# Locals window

![Locals window](../../../images/local_ZA01201622.gif)

Automatically displays all of the declared variables in the current procedure and their values.

When the Locals window is visible, it is automatically updated every time there is a change from [run time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#run-time) to [break mode](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#break-mode) or you navigate in the stack display.

You can:

- Resize the column headers by dragging the border to the right or the left.
    
- Close the window by clicking the **Close** box. If the **Close** box is not visible, double-click the title bar to make the **Close** box visible, and then select it.
