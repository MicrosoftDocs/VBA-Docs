# Expected array

A [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) name with a subscript indicates the variable is an[array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array). This error has the following cause and solution:



- The syntax you specified is appropriate for an array, but no array with this name is in [scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope).
    
    Check to make sure the name of the variable is spelled correctly. Unless the [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module) contains **Option Explicit**, a variable is created on first use. If you misspell the name of an array variable, the variable may be created, but not as an array.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
