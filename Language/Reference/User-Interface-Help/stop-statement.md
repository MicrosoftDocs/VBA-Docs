# Stop Statement

Suspends execution.

## Syntax

**Stop**

## Remarks

You can place  **Stop** statements anywhere in[procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) to suspend execution. Using the **Stop** statement is similar to setting a[breakpoint](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#breakpoint) in the code.
The  **Stop** statement suspends execution, but unlike **End**, it doesn't close any files or clear[variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable), unless it is in a compiled executable (.exe) file.

## Example

This example uses the  **Stop** statement to suspend execution for each iteration through the **For...Next** loop.


```vb
Dim I 
For I = 1 To 10 ' Start For...Next loop. 
 Debug.Print I ' Print I to the Immediate window. 
 Stop ' Stop during each iteration. 
Next I 

```
