# Caption property (Microsoft Forms)

Descriptive text that appears on an object to identify or describe it.

## Syntax

_object_.**Caption** [= _String_ ]

The **Caption** property syntax has these parts:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _String_|Optional. A string expression that evaluates to the text displayed as the caption.|

## Settings

The default setting for a control is a unique name based on the type of control. For example, CommandButton1 is the default caption for the first command button in a form.

## Remarks

The text identifies or describes the object with which it is associated. For buttons and labels, the **Caption** property specifies the text that appears in the control. For **Page** and **Tab** objects, it specifies the text that appears on the tab.

If a control's caption is too long, the caption is truncated. If a form's caption is too long for the title bar, the title is displayed with an ellipsis.

The **ForeColor** property of the control determines the color of the text in the caption.

> [!TIP] 
> If a control has both the **Caption** and **AutoSize** properties, setting **AutoSize** to **True** automatically adjusts the size of the control to frame the entire caption.
