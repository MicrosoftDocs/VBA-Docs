# Specified library or project already referenced

The  **Add References** dialog box displays referenced libraries and[projects](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You chose the  **Browse** button in the **Add References** dialog box, then selected a[type library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-library) or project that was already listed in the **Available References** section of the **Add References** dialog box.
    
    To make a project or type library part of your project, display the  **References** dialog box and make sure the type library or project name is checked.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
