# Breakpoint not allowed on this line

[Breakpoints](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Breakpoint) can only be placed on certain parts of statements. This error has the following causes:

- You tried to place a breakpoint on a line that can't accept a breakpoint, for example:
    
  - A line that contains only [comments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#comment).
    
  - A line that contains only [line labels](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#line-label).
    
  - A line that contains only [declarations](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#declaration) (**Const**, **Dim**, **Static**, **Type**, and so on).
    
  - Any line in a hidden [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module).
    
  - Any line in the **Immediate** window.
