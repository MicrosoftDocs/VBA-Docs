# The specified region has been searched

When you click the  **Find Next** and **Replace** buttons in the **Replace** dialog box, the total number of replacements isn't specified. This condition has the following cause and effect:



- When doing a search and replace operation, you can specify the region to be covered: a selection, a [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure), a [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module), or a [project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project).
    
    If a region is selected, it is the default search region. If no region is selected, the current module is the default search region. To change the [scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope) of a search, select a different option in the **Replace** dialog box.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
