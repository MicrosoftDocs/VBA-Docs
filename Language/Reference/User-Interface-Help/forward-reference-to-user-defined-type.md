# Forward reference to user-defined type

A [user-defined type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#user-defined-type) must be defined before it can be referenced. This error has the following causes and solutions:

- You declared a [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) with a user-defined type before the definition of the user-defined type appears. In the following example, the variable `OtherVar` is declared before its type (`OtherType`) is known:
    
  ```vb
    Type MyType 
    OtherVar As OtherType 
    End Type 
    
    Type OtherType 
    WholeVar As Integer 
    RealVar As Double 
    End Type 
  ```

  Reposition the type definitions so that the forward reference doesn't occur.
    
- You nested a user-defined type within itself.
    
  ```vb
    Type MyType 
    MyVar As Integer 
    OtherVar As MyType 
    End Type 
  ```

  Remove the self-referencing nested type. This may occur indirectly if you nest a type within another type in which the first is already declared. Check the definition of each nested type to eliminate duplication.
