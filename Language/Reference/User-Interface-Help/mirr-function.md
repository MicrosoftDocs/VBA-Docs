# MIRR Function



Returns a [Double](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Double) specifying the modified internal rate of return for a series of periodic cash flows (payments and receipts).

## Syntax

**MIRR( _values_ (),** **_finance_rate_**, **_reinvest_rate_ )**
The  **MIRR** function has these[named arguments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#named-argument):


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**_values_ ()**|Required. [Array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Array) of **Double** specifying cash flow values. The array must contain at least one negative value (a payment) and one positive value (a receipt).|
|**_finance_rate_**|Required.  **Double** specifying interest rate paid as the cost of financing.|
|**_reinvest_rate_**|Required.  **Double** specifying interest rate received on gains from cash reinvestment.|

## Remarks

The modified internal rate of return is the internal rate of return when payments and receipts are financed at different rates. The  **MIRR** function takes into account both the cost of the investment (**_finance_rate_**) and the interest rate received on reinvestment of cash (**_reinvest_rate_**).
The  **_finance_rate_** and **_reinvest_rate_**[arguments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) are percentages expressed as decimal values. For example, 12 percent is expressed as 0.12.
The  **MIRR** function uses the order of values within the array to interpret the order of payments and receipts. Be sure to enter your payment and receipt values in the correct sequence.

## Example

This example uses the  **MIRR** function to return the modified internal rate of return for a series of cash flows contained in the array `Values()`.  `LoanAPR` represents the financing interest, and `InvAPR` represents the interest rate received on reinvestment.


```vb
Dim LoanAPR, InvAPR, Fmt, RetRate, Msg
Static Values(5) As Double    ' Set up array.
LoanAPR = .1    ' Loan rate.
InvAPR = .12    ' Reinvestment rate.
Fmt = "#0.00"    ' Define money format.
Values(0) = -70000    ' Business start-up costs.
' Positive cash flows reflecting income for four successive years.
Values(1) = 22000 : Values(2) = 25000
Values(3) = 28000 : Values(4) = 31000
RetRate = MIRR(Values(), LoanAPR, InvAPR)    ' Calculate internal rate.
Msg = "The modified internal rate of return for these five cash flows is"
Msg = Msg & Format(Abs(RetRate) * 100, Fmt) & "%."
MsgBox Msg    ' Display internal return 
        ' rate.
```
