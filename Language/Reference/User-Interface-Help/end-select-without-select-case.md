# End Select without Select Case

 **End Select** must be matched with a preceding **Select Case**. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You used an  **End Select** statement without a corresponding **Select Case** statement. This is usually due to an extra **End Select** below a **Select Case** block, or leaving behind the **End Select** statement when copying a **Select Case** block from one[procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) to another. Check each **End Select** statement to make sure it terminates a **Select Case** structure.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
