# Private Statement

Used at [module level](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module-level) to declare private[variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) and allocate storage space.

## Syntax

**Private** [ **WithEvents** ] _varname_ [ **(** [ _subscripts_ ] **)** ] [ **As** [ **New** ] _type_ ] [ **,** [ **WithEvents** ] _varname_ [ **(** [ _subscripts_ ] **)** ] [ **As** [ **New** ] _type_ ]] **. . .**

The  **Private** statement syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**WithEvents**|Optional. [Keyword](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Keyword) that specifies that _varname_ is an[object variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-variable) used to respond to events triggered by an[ActiveX object](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#ActiveX-object).  **WithEvents** is valid only in[class modules](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#class-module). You can declare as many individual variables as you like using  **WithEvents**, but you can't create[arrays](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array) with **WithEvents**. You can't use **New** with **WithEvents**.|
| _varname_|Required. Name of the variable; follows standard variable naming conventions.|
| _subscripts_|Optional. Dimensions of an array variable; up to 60 multiple dimensions may be declared. The  _subscripts_[argument](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) uses the following syntax:|
|
|[ _lower_**To** ] _upper_ [ **,** [ _lower_**To** ] _upper_ ] **. . .**|
|
|When not explicitly stated in  _lower_, the lower bound of an array is controlled by the **Option** **Base** statement. The lower bound is zero if no **Option** **Base** statement is present.|
|**New**|Optional. Keyword that enables implicit creation of an object. If you use  **New** when declaring the object variable, a new instance of the object is created on first reference to it, so you don't have to use the **Set** statement to assign the object reference. The **New** keyword can't be used to declare variables of any intrinsic[data type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#data-type), can't be used to declare instances of dependent objects, and can't be used with  **WithEvents**.|
| _type_|Optional. Data type of the variable; may be [Byte](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Byte), [Boolean](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Boolean), [Integer](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Integer), [Long](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Long), [Currency](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Currency), [Single](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Single), [Double](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Double), [Decimal](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Decimal) (not currently supported),[Date](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Date), [String](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#String) (for variable-length strings), **String** * _length_ (for fixed-length strings),[Object](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Object), [Variant](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Variant), a [user-defined type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#user-defined-type), or an [object type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-type). Use a separate  **As**_type_ clause for each variable being defined.|

## Remarks

**Private** variables are available only to the module in which they are declared.
Use the  **Private** statement to declare the data type of a variable. For example, the following statement declares a variable as an **Integer**:



```vb
Private NumberOfEmployees As Integer 

```

You can also use a  **Private** statement to declare the object type of a variable. The following statement declares a variable for a new instance of a worksheet.



```vb
Private X As New Worksheet 

```

If the  **New** keyword isn't used when declaring an object variable, the variable that refers to the object must be assigned an existing object using the **Set** statement before it can be used. Until it's assigned an object, the declared object variable has the special value **Nothing**, which indicates that it doesn't refer to any particular instance of an object.
If you don't specify a data type or object type, and there is no  **Def**_type_ statement in the module, the variable is **Variant** by default.
You can also use the  **Private** statement with empty parentheses to declare a dynamic array. After declaring a dynamic array, use the **ReDim** statement within a procedure to define the number of dimensions and elements in the array. If you try to redeclare a dimension for an array variable whose size was explicitly specified in a **Private**, **Public**, or **Dim** statement, an error occurs.
When variables are initialized, a numeric variable is initialized to 0, a variable-length string is initialized to a zero-length string (""), and a fixed-length string is filled with zeros.  **Variant** variables are initialized to[Empty](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Empty). Each element of a user-defined type variable is initialized as if it were a separate variable.

 **Note**  When you use the  **Private** statement in a procedure, you generally put the **Private** statement at the beginning of the procedure.


## Example

This example shows the  **Private** statement being used at the module level to declare variables as private; that is, they are available only to the module in which they are declared.


```vb
Private Number As Integer ' Private Integer variable. 
Private NameArray(1 To 5) As String ' Private array variable. 
' Multiple declarations, two Variants and one Integer, all Private. 
Private MyVar, YourVar, ThisVar As Integer 

```
