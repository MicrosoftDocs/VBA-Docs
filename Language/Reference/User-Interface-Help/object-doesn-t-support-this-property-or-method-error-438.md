# Object doesn't support this property or method (Error 438)

Not all objects support all [properties](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) and[methods](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#method). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You specified a method or property that doesn't exist for this [Automation object](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#automation-object).
    
    See the object's documentation for more information on the object and check the spellings of properties and methods.
    
- You specified a  **Friend** procedure to be called late bound. The name of a **Friend** procedure must be known at[compile time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#compile-time). It can't appear in a late-bound call.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
