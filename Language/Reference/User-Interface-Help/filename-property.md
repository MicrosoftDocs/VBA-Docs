# FileName Property



Returns the full path name of the project file or host document.

## Syntax

_object_**.Filename**
The  _object_ placeholder represents an[object expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-expression) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.

## Remarks

Projects have no name other than the file name.
The path name returned is always provided as an absolute path (for example, "c:\projects\myproject.vba"), even if it is shown as a relative path (such as "..\projects\myproject.vba").
