# Code Window


![Code window](../../../images/code_ZA01201588.gif)



Use the  **Code** window to write, display, and edit Visual Basic code. You can open as many **Code** windows as you have modules, so you can easily view the code in different forms or[modules](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module), and copy and paste between them.

You can open a  **Code** window from:



- The  **Project** window, by selecting a form or module, and choosing the **View** **Code** button.
    
- A  **UserForm** window, by double-clicking a[control](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#control) or form, choosing **Code** from the **View** menu, or pressing F7.
    

You can drag selected text to:


- A different location in the current  **Code** window.
    
- Another  **Code** window.
    
- The  **Immediate** and **Watch** windows.
    
- The  **Recycle** **Bin**.
    


## Window Elements

 **Object Box**

Displays the name of the selected object. Click the arrow to the right of the list box to display a list of all objects associated with the form.

 **Procedures/Events Box**

Lists all the events recognized by Visual Basic for a form or control displayed in the Object box. When you select an event, the event procedure associated with that event name is displayed in the  **Code** window.

If (General) is displayed in the Object box, the Procedure box lists any declarations and all of the [general procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#general-procedure) that have been created for the form. If you are editing module code, the Procedure box lists all of the general procedures in the module. In either case, the procedure you select in the Procedure box is displayed in the **Code** window.

All the procedures in a module appear in a single, scrollable list that is sorted alphabetically by name. Selecting a procedure using the drop down list boxes at the top of the  **Code** window moves the cursor to the first line of code in the procedure you select.

 **Split Bar**

Dragging this bar down, splits the  **Code** window into two horizontal panes, each of which scrolls separately. You can then view different parts of your code at the same time. The information that appears in the Object box and Procedures/Events box applies to the code in the pane that has the[focus](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#focus). Dragging the bar to the top or the bottom of the window or double-clicking the bar closes a pane.

 **Margin Indicator Bar**

A gray area on the left side of the  **Code** window where[margin indicators](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#margin-indicator) are displayed.
