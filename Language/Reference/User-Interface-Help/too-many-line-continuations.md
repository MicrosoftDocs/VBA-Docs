# Too many line continuations

There is a limit to the number of lines you can join with [line-continuation characters](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#line-continuation-character). This error has the following cause and solution:



- Your code has more than 25 physical lines lines joined with line-continuation characters, or more than 24 consecutive line-continuation characters in a single line. Make some of the constituent lines physically longer to reduce the number of line-continuation characters needed, or break the construct into more than one statement.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
