# Destination label too far away; loop, Select Case, or block If too large

[Procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Procedure) can be as large as 64K from beginning to end, but because branching can occur either forward or backward within a procedure, such branching is limited to 32,767 bytes in either direction. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You have a branching statement (**GoTo**, **GoSub**) whose destination label is farther away than 32,767 bytes from the source branching statement. Move the label closer, or make the procedure smaller.
    
- You have a very large loop structure that occupies more than 32K of memory from beginning to end. Make the loop smaller.
    
- You have a very large block  **If** structure that contains a **Then** or **Else** clause that occupies more than 32K of memory from beginning to end. Reduce the size of the offending portion of the structure.
