# File already exists (Error 58)

This error has the following causes and solutions:



- This error occurs at [run time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#run-time) when the new file name, for example, one specified in a **Name** statement, is identical to a file name that already exists.
    
    Specify a new file name in the  **Name** statement or delete the old file before specifying it in a **Name** statement.
    
- You used the  **Save As** command to save a currently loaded[project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project), but the project name already exists.
    
    Use a different project name if you don't want to replace the other project.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
