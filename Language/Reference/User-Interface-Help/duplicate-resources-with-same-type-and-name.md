# Duplicate resources with same type and name

A Microsoft Windows resource file typically contains bitmaps, text strings, and other similar data used by an application. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- The Windows resource file you are trying to use in your [project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) contains two or more resources with the same type and name, or the file contains a resource that Visual Basic automatically creates.
    
    Use another resource file, or recreate the invalid resource file and delete one of the duplicate resources.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
