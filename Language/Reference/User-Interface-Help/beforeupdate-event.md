# BeforeUpdate Event



Occurs before data in a control is changed.

## Syntax

**Private Sub**_object_ _**BeforeUpdate( ByVal**_Cancel_**As MSForms.ReturnBoolean)**
The  **BeforeUpdate** event syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _Cancel_|Required. Event status.  **False** indicates that the control should handle the event (default). **True** cancels the update and indicates the application should handle the event.|

## Remarks

The BeforeUpdate event occurs regardless of whether the control is [bound](../../../language/Glossary/glossary-vba.md#bound) (that is, when the **RowSource** property specifies a[data source](../../../language/Glossary/glossary-vba.md#data-source) for the control). This event occurs before the AfterUpdate and Exit events for the control (and before the Enter event for the next control that receives[focus](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#focus)).
If you set the  _Cancel_ argument to **True**, the focus remains on the control and neither the AfterUpdate event nor the Exit event occurs.
