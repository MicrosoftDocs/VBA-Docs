# Object doesn't support this action (Error 445)

Not all objects support all actions. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You referenced a [method](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#method) or [property](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) that isn't supported by this object.
    
    See the object's documentation for more information on the object and check the spellings of properties and methods.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
