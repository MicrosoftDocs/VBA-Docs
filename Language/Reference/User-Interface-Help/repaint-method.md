# Repaint method (Microsoft Forms)

Updates the display by redrawing the form or page.

_Boolean_ = _object_. **Repaint**

The **Repaint** method syntax has these parts:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|

## Remarks

The **Repaint** method is useful if the contents or appearance of an object changes significantly, and you don't want to wait until the system automatically repaints the area.
