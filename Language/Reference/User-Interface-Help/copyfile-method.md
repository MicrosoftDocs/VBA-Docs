# CopyFile method

Copies one or more files from one location to another.

## Syntax

_object_.**CopyFile** _source_, _destination_, [ _overwrite_ ]

<br/>

The **CopyFile** method syntax has these parts:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. The _object_ is always the name of a **[FileSystemObject](filesystemobject-object.md)**.|
| _source_|Required. Character string file specification, which can include wildcard characters, for one or more files to be copied.|
| _destination_|Required. Character string destination where the file or files from _source_ are to be copied. Wildcard characters are not allowed.|
| _overwrite_|Optional. **Boolean** value that indicates if existing files are to be overwritten. If **True**, files are overwritten; if **False**, they are not. The default is **True**. Note that **CopyFile** will fail if _destination_ has the read-only attribute set, regardless of the value of _overwrite_.|

## Remarks

Wildcard characters can only be used in the last path component of the _source_ argument. For example, you can use:

```vb
FileSystemObject.CopyFile "c:\mydocuments\letters\*.doc", "c:\tempfolder\"

```

But you can't use:

```vb
FileSystemObject.CopyFile "c:\mydocuments\*\R1???97.xls", "c:\tempfolder"

```

If _source_ contains wildcard characters, or _destination_ ends with a path separator (**\**), it is assumed that _destination_ is an existing folder in which to copy matching files. Otherwise, _destination_ is assumed to be the name of a file to create. In either case, three things can happen when an individual file is copied:

- If _destination_ does not exist, _source_ gets copied. This is the usual case.
    
- If _destination_ is an existing file, an error occurs if _overwrite_ is **False**. Otherwise, an attempt is made to copy _source_ over the existing file.
    
- If _destination_ is a directory, an error occurs.
    

An error also occurs if a _source_ using wildcard characters doesn't match any files. The **CopyFile** method stops on the first error it encounters. No attempt is made to roll back or undo any changes made before an error occurs.
