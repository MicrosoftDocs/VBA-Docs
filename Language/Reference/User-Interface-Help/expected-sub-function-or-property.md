# Expected Sub, Function, or Property

The syntax of your statement indicates a  **Sub**, **Function**, or **Property** procedure invocation. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The specified name isn't that of a  **Sub**, **Function**, or **Property** procedure in [scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope) in this part of your program.
    
    Check the spelling of the name. Note that if the [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) is defined as **Private**, it can only be called from within its [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module).
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
