# TakeFocusOnClick Property



Specifies whether a control takes the [focus](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#focus) when clicked.

## Syntax

_object_. **TakeFocusOnClick** [= _Boolean_ ]
The  **TakeFocusOnClick** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _Boolean_|Optional. Specifies whether a control takes the focus when clicked.|

 **Settings**
The settings for  _Boolean_ are:


|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**True**|The button takes the focus when clicked (default).|
|**False**|The button does not take the focus when clicked.|

## Remarks

The  **TakeFocusOnClick** property defines only what happens when the user clicks a control. If the user tabs to the control, the control takes the focus regardless of the value of **TakeFocusOnClick**.
Use this property to complete actions that affect a control without requiring that control to give up focus. For example, assume your form includes a  **TextBox** and a **CommandButton** that checks for correct spelling of text. You would like to be able to select text in the **TextBox**, then click the **CommandButton** and run the spelling checker without taking focus away from the **TextBox**. You can do this by setting the **TakeFocusOnClick** property of the **CommandButton** to **False**.
