# Invalid property value (Error 380) [2 of 2]

An inappropriate value is assigned to a [property](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to set one of the properties of an object or control to a value outside its permissible range. Change the property value to a valid setting. For example, the  **MousePointer** property must be set to an integer from 0 - 15 or 99.
