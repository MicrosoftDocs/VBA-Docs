# Property Set can't be executed at run time (Error 382)

It may not be possible to obtain a reference to a [property](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) at[run time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#run-time).This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to get a reference to a property that's either read-only or write-only at run time. Since you can use a reference for both reading and writing, the property must provide run-time support for both operations for a reference to be obtained at run time.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
