# License information for this component not found. You don't have an appropriate license to use this functionality in the design environment (Error 429)

You are not a licensed user of the [ActiveX control](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#activex-control). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to place an ActiveX control on a form at [design time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#design-time) or tried to add a form with an ActiveX control on it to a [project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project), but the associated information in the [registry](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#registry) could not be found.
    
    The information in the registry may have been deleted or become corrupted. Reinstall the ActiveX control or contact the control vendor.
