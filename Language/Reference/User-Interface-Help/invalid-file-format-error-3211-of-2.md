# Invalid file format (Error 321) [1 of 2]

A Visual Basic form file is damaged. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- The form has a damaged [ActiveX control](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#ActiveX-control).
    
    Try replacing the ActiveX control on the form.
    
- The number of properties in the current version of the ActiveX control doesn't match the expected number of properties. Try replacing the ActiveX control with an earlier version or later version.
