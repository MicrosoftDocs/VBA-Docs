# Date Data Type

[Date variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md) are stored as IEEE 64-bit (8-byte) floating-point numbers that represent dates ranging from 1 January 100 to 31 December 9999 and times from 0:00:00 to 23:59:59. Any recognizable literal date values can be assigned to **Date** variables.[Date literals](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#date-literal) must be enclosed within number signs (**#**), for example, `#January 1, 1993#` or or `#1 Jan 93#`.

 **Date** variables display dates according to the short date format recognized by your computer. Times display according to the time format (either 12-hour or 24-hour) recognized by your computer.

When other [numeric types](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#numeric-type) are converted to **Date**, values to the left of the decimal represent date information while values to the right of the decimal represent time. Midnight is 0 and midday is 0.5. Negative whole numbers represent dates before 30 December 1899.
