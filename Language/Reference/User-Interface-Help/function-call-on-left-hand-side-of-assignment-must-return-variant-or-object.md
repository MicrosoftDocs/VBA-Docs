# Function call on left-hand side of assignment must return Variant or Object

A function call can appear on the left side of an assignment, but only if the return value of the function is an  **Object** or **Variant**. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The return type of the function on the left side of the assignment isn't a  **Variant** or **Object**. Change the return type. Note that if the return value is an object or a **Variant** that contains an object, the assignment is to the default[property](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) of the object. If the **Variant** returned isn't an object, the assignment has no effect.
    
- Everything in the call is correct, however, it can't be completed. For example, you may be trying to set a property that can only be set at design time. Enter design mode and set the property in the  **Property** window. Remove the code that tried to set the property programmatically.
