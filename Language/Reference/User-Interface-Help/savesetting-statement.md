An error occurs if the key setting can't be saved for any reason.

## Example

The following example first uses the  **SaveSetting** statement to make entries in the Windows registry (or .ini file on 16-bit Windows platforms) for the application, and then uses the **DeleteSetting** statement to remove them.


```vb
' Place some settings in the registry. 
SaveSetting appname := "MyApp", section := "Startup", _ 
 key := "Top", setting := 75 
SaveSetting "MyApp","Startup", "Left", 50 
' Remove section and all its settings from registry. 
DeleteSetting "MyApp", "Startup" 

```
