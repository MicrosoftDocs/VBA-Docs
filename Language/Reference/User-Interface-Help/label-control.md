## Remarks

A  **Label** control on a form displays descriptive text such as titles, captions, pictures, or brief instructions. For example, labels for an address book might include a **Label** for a name, street, or city. A **Label** doesn't display values from[data sources](../../../language/Glossary/glossary-vba.md#data-source) or expressions; it is always[unbound](../../../language/Glossary/glossary-vba.md#unbound) and doesn't change as you move from record to record.
The default property for a  **Label** is the **Caption** property.
The default event for a  **Label** is the Click event.
