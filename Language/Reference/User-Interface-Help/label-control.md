# Label control

Displays descriptive text.

## Remarks

A **Label** control on a form displays descriptive text such as titles, captions, pictures, or brief instructions. For example, labels for an address book might include a **Label** for a name, street, or city. 

A **Label** doesn't display values from [data sources](../../Glossary/glossary-vba.md#data-source) or expressions; it is always [unbound](../../Glossary/glossary-vba.md#unbound) and doesn't change as you move from record to record.

The default property for a **Label** is the **Caption** property. The default event for a **Label** is the Click event.
