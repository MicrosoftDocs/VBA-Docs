# Do without Loop

Each **Do** must be matched with a terminating **Loop**. This error has the following cause and solution:



- A **Do** statement was used without a terminating **Loop** statement. Check that other control structures within the **Do...Loop** structure are correctly matched. For example, a block **If** without a matching **End If** inside the **Do...Loop** structure may generate this error.
