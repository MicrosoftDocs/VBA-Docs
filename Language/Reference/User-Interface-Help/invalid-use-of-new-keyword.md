# Invalid use of New keyword

The **New** keyword can only be applied to a creatable object (an instance of a [class](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#class) or [Automation object](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Automation-object)). This error has the following causes and solutions:

- You tried to instantiate something that can have only one instance. For example, you tried to create a new instance of a [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module) by specifying `Module1` in a statement like the following:
    
  ```vb
    Dim MyMod As New Module1 
  ```

  You can't create the new instance, since a module can have only one instance.
    
- You tried to instantiate an Automation object, but it was not a creatable object. For example, you tried to create a new instance of a list box by specifying **ListBox** in a statement like the following:
    
  ```vb
      ' Valid syntax to create the variable. 
    Dim MyListBox As ListBox     
    Dim MyFormInst As Form 
    ' Invalid syntax to instantiate the object. 
    Set MyFormInst = New Form 
    Set MyListBox = New ListBox 
  ```

  **ListBox** and **Form** are class names, not specific object names. You can use them to specify that a [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) will be a reference to a certain [object type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-type), as with the valid **Dim** statements above. But you can't use them to instantiate the objects themselves in a **Set** statement. You must specify a specific object, rather than the generic class name, in the **Set** statement:
    
  ```vb
      ' Valid syntax to create new instance of a form or list box. 
    Set MyFormInst = New Form1 
    Set MyListBox = New List1 
  ```
