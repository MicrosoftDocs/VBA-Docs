# Object variable not set (Error 91)

There are two steps to creating an [object variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-variable). First you must declare the object variable. Then you must assign a valid reference to the object variable using the **Set** statement. Similarly, a **With...End With** block must be initialized by executing the **With** statement entry point. This error has the following causes and solutions:

- You attempted to use an object variable that isn't yet referencing a valid object.
    
  Specify or respecify a reference for the object variable. For example, if the **Set** statement is omitted in the following code, an error would be generated on the reference to `MyObject`:
    
  ```vb
    Dim MyObject As Object    ' Create object variable. 
    Set MyObject = Sheets(1)    ' Create valid object reference. 
    MyCount = MyObject.Count    ' Assign Count value to MyCount. 
  ```

- You attempted to use an object variable that has been set to **Nothing**.
    
  ```vb
    Set MyObject = Nothing    ' Release the object. 
    MyCount = MyObject.Count    ' Make a reference to a released object. 
  ```

  Respecify a reference for the object variable. For example, use a new **Set** statement to set a new reference to the object.
    
- The object is a valid object, but it wasn't set because the [object library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-library) in which it is described hasn't been selected in the **Add References** dialog box.
    
  Select the object library in the **Add References** dialog box.
    
- The target of a **GoTo** statement is inside a **With** block.
    
  Don't jump into a **With** block. Make sure the block is initialized by executing the **With** statement entry point.
    
- You specified a line inside a **With** block when you chose the **Set Next Statement** command.
    
  The **With** block must be initialized by executing the **With** statement.
