# Item Method (Microsoft Forms)



Returns a member of a [collection](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#collection), either by position or by name.

## Syntax

**Set**_Object_ = _object_. **Item(**_collectionindex_**)**
The  **Item** method syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _collectionindex_|Required. A member's position, or index, within a collection.|

 **Settings**
The  _collectionindex_ can be either a string or an integer. If it is a string, it must be a valid member name. If it is an integer, the minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is one less than the number of items in the collection.

## Remarks

If an invalid index or name is specified, an error occurs.
