# Line too long

A physical line of Visual Basic code can contain up to 1023 characters. This error has the following cause and solution:



- A line contains too many characters. You can create a longer logical line by joining physical lines with a [line-continuation character](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#line-continuation-character), a space followed by an underscore ( _). Up to 25 physical lines can be joined with line-continuation characters to form a single logical line, or 24 consecutive line-continuation characters. Thus, a logical line could potentially contain a total of 10,230 characters. Beyond that, you must break the line into individual statements or assign some [expressions](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#expression) to intermediate[variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable).
