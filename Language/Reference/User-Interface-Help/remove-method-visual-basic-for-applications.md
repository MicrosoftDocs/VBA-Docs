# Remove method (VBA)

Removes a [member](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#member) from a **[Collection](collection-object.md)** object.

## Syntax

_object_.**Remove** _index_

The **Remove** method syntax has the following object qualifier and part:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. An [object expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-expression) that evaluates to an object in the **Applies To** list.|
| _index_|Required. An [expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#expression) that specifies the position of a member of the [collection](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#collection). If a [numeric expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#numeric-expression), _index_ must be a number from 1 to the value of the collection's **[Count](count-property-visual-basic-for-applications.md)** property. If a [string expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#string-expression), _index_ must correspond to the _key_ [argument](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) specified when the member referred to was added to the collection.|

## Remarks

If the value provided as _index_ doesn't match an existing member of the collection, an error occurs.

## Example

This example illustrates the use of the **Remove** method to remove objects from a **Collection** object, `MyClasses`. This code removes the object whose index is 1 on each iteration of the loop.


```vb
Dim Num, MyClasses
For Num = 1 To MyClasses.Count    
    MyClasses.Remove 1    ' Remove the first object each time
            ' through the loop until there are 
            ' no objects left in the collection.
Next Num

```
