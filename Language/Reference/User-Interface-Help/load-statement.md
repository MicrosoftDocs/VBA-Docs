# Load Statement

Loads an object but doesn't show it.

## Syntax

**Load**_object_

The  _object_ placeholder represents an[object expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-expression) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.

## Remarks

When an object is loaded, it is placed in memory, but isn't visible. Use the  **Show** method to make the object visible. Until an object is visible, a user can't interact with it. The object can be manipulated programmatically in its Initialize event procedure.

## Example

In the following example, UserForm2 is loaded during UserForm1's Initialize event. Subsequent clicking on UserForm2 reveals UserForm1.


```vb
' This is the Initialize event procedure for UserForm1 
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() 
 Load UserForm2 
 UserForm2.Show 
End Sub 
' This is the Click event of UserForm2 
Private Sub UserForm_Click() 
 UserForm2.Hide 
End Sub 
 
' This is the click event for UserForm1 
Private Sub UserForm_Click() 
 UserForm2.Show 
End Sub
```
