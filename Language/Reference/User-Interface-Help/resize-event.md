# Resize Event



Occurs when a user form is resized.

## Syntax

**Private Sub UserForm_Resize()**

## Remarks

Use a Resize event [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) to move or resize[controls](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#control) when the parent **UserForm** is resized. You can also use this event procedure to recalculate[variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) or[properties](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#propertie).

## Example

The following example uses the Activate and Click events to illustrate triggering of the  **UserForm's** Resize event. As the user clicks the client area of the form, it grows or shrinks and the new height is specified in the title bar. Note that the **Tag** property is used to store the **UserForm's** initial height.


```vb
' Activate event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Activate()
    UserForm1.Caption = "Click me to make me taller!"
    Tag = Height    ' Save the initial height.
End Sub

' Click event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    Dim NewHeight As Single
    NewHeight = Height
    ' If the form is small, make it tall.
    If NewHeight = Val(Tag) Then
        Height = Val(Tag) * 2
    Else
    ' If the form is tall, make it small.
        Height = Val(Tag)
    End If
End Sub

' Resize event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Resize()
    UserForm1.Caption = "New Height: " & Height & "  " & "Click to resize me!"
End Sub
```
