# Can't assign to an array

Each element of an [array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array) must have its value assigned individually. This error has the following causes and solutions:

- You inadvertently tried to assign a single value to an array [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) without specifying the element to which the value should be assigned.
    
  To assign a single value to an array element, you must specify the element in a subscript. For example, if  `MyArray` is an integer array, the [expression ](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#expression-) ` MyArray = 5` is invalid, but the following expression is valid: `MyArray(UBound(MyArray)) = 5`
    
- You tried to assign a whole array to another array. 
    
  For example, if  `Arr1` is an array and `Arr2` is another array, the following two assignments are both invalid:
    
  ```vb
      Arr1 = Arr2    ' Invalid assignment. 
      Arr1() = Arr2()    ' Invalid assignment. 
  ```

  To assign one array to another, make sure that the array on the left side of the assignment is resizable and the types of the array match.
    
  You can place a whole array in a **Variant**, resulting in a single variant variable containing the whole array:

  ```vb
         Dim MyArr As Variant 
         MyVar = Arr2() 
  ```


  You then reference the elements of the array in the variant with the same subscript notation as for a normal array, for example:
    
  ```vb
    MyVar(3) = MyVar(1) + MyVar(5) 
  ```
