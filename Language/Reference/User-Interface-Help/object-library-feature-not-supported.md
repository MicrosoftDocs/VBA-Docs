# Object library feature not supported

It's possible to have features in an [object library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-library) that have no equivalent in Visual Basic. This error has the following cause and solution:



- An attempt was made to access an object library [data type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#data-type) or function that can't be supported by Visual Basic.
    
    Contact the creator of the object library for more information on when it is appropriate to use the object library, and the tools with which it should be used.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
