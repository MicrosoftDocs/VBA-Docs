# Saved Property (VBA Add-In Object Model)



Returns a [Boolean](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Boolean) value indicating whether or not the object was edited since the last time it was saved. Read/write.
 **Return Values**
The  **Saved** property returns these values:


|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**True**|The object has not been edited since the last time it was saved.|
|**False**|The object has been edited since the last time it was saved.|

## Remarks

The  **SaveAs** method sets the **Saved** property to **True**.

 **Note**  If you set the  **Saved** property to **False** in code, it returns **False**, and the object is marked as if it were edited since the last time it was saved.
