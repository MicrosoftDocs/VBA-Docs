# + Operator



Used to sum two numbers.

## Syntax

_result_ **=** _expression1 + expression2_.
The  **+** operator syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _result_|Required; any numeric [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable).|
| _expression1_|Required; any [expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#expression).|
| _expression2_|Required; any expression.|

## Remarks

When you use the  **+** operator, you may not be able to determine whether addition or string concatenation will occur. Use the **&;** operator for concatenation to eliminate ambiguity and provide self-documenting code.
If at least one expression is not a [Variant](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Variant), the following rules apply:


|**If**|**Then**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Both expressions are [numeric data types](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#numeric-data-type) ([Byte](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Byte), [Boolean](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Boolean), [Integer](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Integer), [Long](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Long), [Single](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Single), [Double](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Double), [Date](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Date), [Currency](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Currency), or [Decimal](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Decimal))|Add.|
|Both expressions are [String](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#String)|Concatenate.|
|One expression is a numeric data type and the other is any  **Variant** except [Null](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Null)|Add.|
|One expression is a  **String** and the other is any **Variant** except **Null**|Concatenate.|
|One expression is an [Empty](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Empty) **Variant**|Return the remaining expression unchanged as  _result_.|
|One expression is a numeric data type and the other is a  **String**|A  `Type mismatch`error occurs.|
|Either expression is  **Null**| _result_ is **Null**.|

If both expressions are  **Variant** expressions, the following rules apply:


|**If**|**Then**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Both  **Variant** expressions are numeric|Add.|
|Both  **Variant** expressions are strings|Concatenate.|
|One  **Variant** expression is numeric and the other is a string|Add.|

For simple arithmetic addition involving only expressions of numeric data types, the [data type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#data-type) of _result_ is usually the same as that of the most precise expression. The order of precision, from least to most precise, is **Byte**, **Integer**, **Long**, **Single**, **Double**, **Currency**, and **Decimal**. The following are exceptions to this order:


|**If**|**Then  _result_ is**|
|:-----|:-----|
|A  **Single** and a **Long** are added,|a  **Double**.|
|The data type of  _result_ is a **Long**, **Single**, or **Date** variant that overflows its legal range,|converted to a  **Double** variant.|
|The data type of  _result_ is a **Byte** variant that overflows its legal range,|converted to an  **Integer** variant.|
|The data type of  _result_ is an **Integer** variant that overflows its legal range,|converted to a  **Long** variant.|
|A  **Date** is added to any data type,|a  **Date**.|

If one or both expressions are  **Null** expressions, _result_ is **Null**. If both expressions are **Empty**, _result_ is an **Integer**. However, if only one expression is **Empty**, the other expression is returned unchanged as _result_.

 **Note**  The order of precision used by addition and subtraction is not the same as the order of precision used by multiplication.


## Example

This example uses the  **+** operator to sum numbers. The **+** operator can also be used to concatenate strings. However, to eliminate ambiguity, you should use the **&;** operator instead. If the components of an expression created with the **+** operator include both strings and numerics, the arithmetic result is assigned. If the components are exclusively strings, the strings are concatenated.


```vb
Dim MyNumber, Var1, Var2
MyNumber = 2 + 2    ' Returns 4.
MyNumber = 4257.04 + 98112    ' Returns 102369.04.

Var1 = "34": Var2 = 6    ' Initialize mixed variables.
MyNumber = Var1 + Var2    ' Returns 40.

Var1 = "34": Var2 = "6"    ' Initialize variables with strings.
MyNumber = Var1 + Var2    ' Returns "346" (string concatenation).

```
