# String data type

There are two kinds of strings: variable-length and fixed-length strings.

- A variable-length string can contain up to approximately 2 billion (2^31) characters.
    
- A fixed-length string can contain 1 to approximately 64 K (2^16) characters.
    
  > [!NOTE] 
  > A [Public](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#public) fixed-length string can't be used in a [class module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#class-module).

The codes for [String](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#string-data-type) characters range from 0&ndash;255. The first 128 characters (0&ndash;127) of the character set correspond to the letters and symbols on a standard U.S. keyboard. These first 128 characters are the same as those defined by the [ASCII](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#ascii-character-set) character set. The second 128 characters (128&ndash;255) represent special characters, such as letters in international alphabets, accents, currency symbols, and fractions.

The [type-declaration character](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-declaration-character) for **String** is the dollar (**$**) sign.

A double-quotation-mark can be embedded within a [string literal](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#string-literal) in one of two ways:

- Use two double-quotation-marks:

  ```vb
    Dim s As String
    s = "This string literal has an embedded "" in it."
  ```

- Use the Chr function; character code 34 is a double-quotation-mark:

  ```vb
    Dim s As String
    s = "This string literal has an embedded " & Chr(34) & " in it."
  ```

A fixed-length string includes appended spaces or truncates as necessary: 

```vb
    Dim s As String * 3
    Debug.Print Len(s) & " characters [" & s & "]" 'Prints 3 characters [   ]
    s = "a"
    Debug.Print Len(s) & " characters [" & s & "]" 'Prints 3 characters [a  ]
    s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    Debug.Print Len(s) & " characters [" & s & "]" 'Prints 3 characters [abc]
```
