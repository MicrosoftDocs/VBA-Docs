# Windows Collection (VBA Add-In Object Model)



Contains all open or permanent windows.

## Remarks

Use the  **Windows** collection to access **Window** objects.
The  **Windows** collection has a fixed set of windows that are always available in the[collection](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#collection), such as the [Project window](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Project-window), the [Properties window](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Properties-window), and a set of windows that represent all open code windows and [designer](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#designer) windows. Opening a code or designer window adds a new member to the **Windows** collection. Closing a code or designer window removes a member from the **Windows** collection. Closing a permanent[development environment](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#development-environment) window doesn't remove the corresponding object from this collection, but results in the window not being visible.
