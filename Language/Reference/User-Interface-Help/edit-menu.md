# Edit menu

## Bookmarks

Displays a menu that you can use to create or remove placeholders in the [Code window](code-window.md), move to the next or preceding bookmark, or clear all of the bookmarks. Bookmarks mark lines of code so that you can easily return to them at a later time. When you add a bookmark, a ![Bookmark](../../../images/wbkmark_ZA01201807.gif) appears next to the line of code where the bookmark is inserted.
