# Horizontal Spacing Commands (Format Menu)

Changes the horizontal space between selected [objects](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object).

 **Make Equal**

Moves the selected objects so that there is equal space between them using the outermost objects as endpoints. The outermost objects do not move.

Increases horizontal spacing by one grid unit based on the object with focus. When an object has focus, white handles appear on its borders. You can change the size of your grid units in the  **General** tab of the **Options** dialog box.

 **Note**  The object with focus does not move but the other objects move around it.


 **Note**  If using the  **Horizontal** **Spacing** command does not produce the results you want, try to manually rearrange some of the objects and repeat the command. Also, try the using the **Vertical** **Spacing** command.
