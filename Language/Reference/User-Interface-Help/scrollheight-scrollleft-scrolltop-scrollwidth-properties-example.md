# ScrollHeight, ScrollLeft, ScrollTop, ScrollWidth properties example

The following example uses a page of a **[MultiPage](multipage-control.md)** as a scrolling region. The user can use the scroll bars on Page2 of the **MultiPage** to gain access to parts of the page that are not initially displayed.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Declarations portion of a form. Make sure that the form contains a **MultiPage** named MultiPage1, and that each page of the **MultiPage** contains one or more controls.

> [!NOTE] 
> Each page of a **MultiPage** is unique. Page1 has no scroll bars. Page2 has horizontal and vertical scroll bars.

```vb
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() 
 MultiPage1.Pages(1).ScrollBars = fmScrollBarsBoth 
 MultiPage1.Pages(1).KeepScrollBarsVisible = _ 
 fmScrollBarsNone 
 
 MultiPage1.Pages(1).ScrollHeight = 2 * _ 
 MultiPage1.Height 
 MultiPage1.Pages(1).ScrollWidth = 2 * _ 
 MultiPage1.Width 
 
 'Set ScrollHeight, ScrollWidth before setting 
 'ScrollLeft, ScrollTop 
 MultiPage1.Pages(1).ScrollLeft = _ 
 MultiPage1.Width / 2 
 MultiPage1.Pages(1).ScrollTop = _ 
 MultiPage1.Height / 2 
End Sub
```
