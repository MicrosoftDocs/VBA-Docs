# Integer Data Type

[Integer variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Integer-variable) are stored as 16-bit (2-byte) numbers ranging in value from -32,768 to 32,767. The[type-declaration character](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-declaration-character) for **Integer** is the percent sign (**%**).

You can also use  **Integer** variables to represent enumerated values. An enumerated value can contain a finite set of unique whole numbers, each of which has special meaning in the context in which it is used. Enumerated values provide a convenient way to select among a known number of choices, for example, black = 0, white = 1, and so on. It is good programming practice to define[constants](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#constant) using the **Const** statement for each enumerated value.
