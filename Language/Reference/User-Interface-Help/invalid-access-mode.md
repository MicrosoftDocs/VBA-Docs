# Invalid Access mode

In your **Open** statement, you specified a type of access that was invalid for the specified file type. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You attempted to open a file for **Input**, but specified an illegal access mode. You can omit the access mode specification when opening a file for input, but if you specify it, the access mode must be **Read**. Both **Write** and **Read Write** are invalid access modes on a file opened for **Input**.
    
- You attempted to open a file for **Append**, but specified an invalid access mode. You can omit the access mode specification when opening a file for append, but if you specify it, the access mode must be **Write**. Both **Read** and **Read Write** are invalid access modes on a file opened for **Append**.
    
- You attempted to open a file for **Output**, but specified an invalid access mode. You can omit the access mode specification when opening a file for output, but if you specify it, the access mode must be **Write**. Both **Read** and **Read Write** are invalid access modes on a file opened for **Output**.
