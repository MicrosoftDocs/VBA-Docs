# WhatsThisHelp Property



Returns a [Boolean](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Boolean) value that determines whether context-sensitive Help uses the pop-up window provided by Windows 95 Help or the main Help window. Read-only at[run time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#run-time). This property does not apply to the Macintosh.

## Remarks

The settings for the  **WhatsThisHelp** property are:


|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**True**|The application uses one of the What's This access techniques to start Windows Help and load a topic identified by the  **WhatsThisHelpID** property.|
|**False**|(Default) The application uses the F1 key to start Windows Help and load the topic identified by the  **HelpContextID** property.|


## Remarks

There are two access techniques for providing What's This Help in an application. The  **WhatsThisHelp** property must be set to **True** for any of these techniques to work.


- Providing a  **What's This** button on the title bar of the **UserForm** using the **WhatsThisButton** property. The mouse pointer changes to the What's This state (arrow with question mark). The topic displayed is identified by the **WhatsThisHelpID** property of the control clicked by the user.
    
- Invoking the  **WhatsThisMode** method of a **UserForm**. This produces the same behavior as clicking the **What's This** button without using a button. For example, you can invoke this method from a command on a menu in the menu bar of the application.
