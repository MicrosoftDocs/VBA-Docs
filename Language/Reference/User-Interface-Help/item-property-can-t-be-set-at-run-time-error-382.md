# 'Item' property can't be set at run time (Error 382)

The [property](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) is read-only at[run time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#run-time). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to set or change a property whose value can only be set at [design time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#design-time).
    
    Remove the reference to the property from your code or change the reference to only return the value of the property at run time.
