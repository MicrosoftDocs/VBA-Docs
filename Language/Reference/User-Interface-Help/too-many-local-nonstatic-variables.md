# Too many local, nonstatic variables

Local, nonstatic [variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) are variables that are defined within a[procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) and reinitialized each time the procedure is called. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The sum of the memory requirements for this procedure's local, nonstatic variables and compiler-generated temporary variables exceeds 32K. Declare some of your variables with the  **Static** statement where appropriate. **Static** variables retain their value between procedure invocations because they are allocated from different memory resources than nonstatic variables.
