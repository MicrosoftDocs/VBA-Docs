# Enabled Property (Microsoft Forms)



Specifies whether a control can receive the [focus](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#focus) and respond to user-generated events.

## Syntax

_object_. **Enabled** [= _Boolean_ ]
The  **Enabled** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _Boolean_|Optional. Whether the object can respond to user-generated events.|

 **Settings**
The settings for  _Boolean_ are:


|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**True**|The control can receive the focus and respond to user-generated events, and is accessible through code (default).|
|**False**|The user cannot interact with the control by using the mouse, keystrokes, accelerators, or hotkeys. The control is generally still accessible through code.|

## Remarks

Use the  **Enabled** property to enable and disable controls. A disabled control appears dimmed, while an enabled control does not. Also, if a control displays a bitmap, the bitmap is dimmed whenever the control is dimmed. If **Enabled** is **False** for an **Image**, the control does not initiate events but does not appear dimmed.
The  **Enabled** and **Locked** properties work together to achieve the following effects:


- If  **Enabled** and **Locked** are both **True**, the control can receive focus and appears normally (not dimmed) in the form. The user can copy, but not edit, data in the control.
    
- If  **Enabled** is **True** and **Locked** is **False**, the control can receive focus and appears normally in the form. The user can copy and edit data in the control.
    
- If  **Enabled** is **False** and **Locked** is **True**, the control cannot receive focus and is dimmed in the form. The user can neither copy nor edit data in the control.
    
- If  **Enabled** and **Locked** are both **False**, the control cannot receive focus and is dimmed in the form. The user can neither copy nor edit data in the control.
    

You can combine the settings of the  **Enabled** and the **TabStop** properties to prevent the user from selecting a command button with TAB, while still allowing the user to click the button. Setting **TabStop** to **False** means that the command button won't appear in the[tab order](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#tab-order). However, if  **Enabled** is **True**, then the user can still click the command button, as long as **TakeFocusOnClick** is set to **True**.
When the user tabs into an enabled  **MultiPage** or **TabStrip**, the first page or tab in the control receives the focus. If the first page or tab of a **MultiPage** or **TabStrip** is disabled, the first enabled page or tab of that control receives the focus. If all pages or tabs of a **MultiPage** or **TabStrip** are disabled, the control is disabled and cannot receive the focus.
If a  **Frame** is disabled, all controls it contains are disabled.
Clicking a disabled  **ListBox** does not initiate the Click event.
