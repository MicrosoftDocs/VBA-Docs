# AddressOf Operator



A unary operator that causes the address of the [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) it precedes to be passed to an API procedure that expects a function pointer at that position in the[argument](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) list.

## Syntax

**AddressOf**_procedurename_
The required  _procedurename_ specifies the procedure whose address is to be passed. It must represent a procedure in a[standard module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#standard-module) module in the[project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) in which the call is made.

## Remarks

When a procedure name appears in an argument list, usually the procedure is evaluated, and the address of the procedure's return value is passed.  **AddressOf** permits the address of the procedure to be passed to a Windows API function in a[dynamic-link library (DLL)](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#dynamic-link-library-(DLL)), rather passing the procedure's return value. The API function can then use the address to call the Basic procedure, a process known as a callback. The  **AddressOf** operator appears only in the call to the API procedure.
Although you can use  **AddressOf** to pass procedure pointers among Basic procedures, you can't call a function through such a pointer from within Basic. This means, for example, that a[class](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#class) written in Basic can't make a callback to its controller using such a pointer. When using **AddressOf** to pass a procedure pointer among procedures within Basic, the[parameter](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#parameter) of the called procedure must be typed **As Long**.
Using  **AddressOf** may cause unpredictable results if you don't completely understand the concept of function callbacks. You must understand how the Basic portion of the callback works, and also the code of the DLL into which you are passing your function address. Debugging such interactions is difficult since the program runs in the same process as the[development environment](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#development-environment). In some cases, systematic debugging may not be possible.

 **Note**  You can create your own call-back function prototypes in DLLs compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ (or similar tools). To work with  **AddressOf**, your prototype must use the __stdcall calling convention. The default calling convention (__cdecl) will not work with **AddressOf**.

Since the caller of a callback is not within your program, it is important that an error in the callback procedure not be propagated back to the caller. You can accomplish this by placing the  **On Error Resume Next** statement at the beginning of the callback procedure.

## Example

The following example creates a form with a list box containing an alphabetically sorted list of the fonts in your system.

To run this example, create a form with a list box on it. The code for the form is as follows:




```vb
Option Explicit

Private Sub Form_Load()
    Module1.FillListWithFonts List1
End Sub
```

Place the following code in a module. The third argument in the definition of the EnumFontFamilies function is a  **Long** that represents a procedure. The argument must contain the address of the procedure, rather than the value that the procedure returns. In the call to EnumFontFamilies, the third argument requires the **AddressOf** operator to return the address of the EnumFontFamProc procedure, which is the name of the callback procedure you supply when calling the Windows API function, **EnumFontFamilies**. Windows calls EnumFontFamProc once for each of the font families on the system when you pass **AddressOf** EnumFontFamProc to **EnumFontFamilies**. The last argument passed to **EnumFontFamilies** specifies the list box in which the information is displayed.
