# Line 'item1': The file 'item2' could not be loaded.

Syntax errors are preventing Visual Basic from parsing and loading a file, or form name conflicts prevent loading of an ASCII form. The form won't be loaded and the form name won't be displayed in the  **Project Explorer**.

Make sure that the file causing this error is a valid ASCII form in the correct format and that no conflicts exist among the different forms in the [project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project).
