# Can't find DLL entry point in specified DLL

An entry point is the name of a DLL (Windows) or code resource (Macintosh) procedure or the ordinal representing the procedure. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- A [type library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-library) incorrectly described the entry point, perhaps misspelling the name or specifying the ordinal incorrectly.
    
    Contact the vendor for a corrected type library.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
