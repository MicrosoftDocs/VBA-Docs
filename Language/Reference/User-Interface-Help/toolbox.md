# Toolbox

![Toolbox](../../../images/toolbox_ZA01201770.gif)

Displays the standard Visual Basic controls plus any ActiveX controls and insertable objects that you have added to your project.

You can customize the **Toolbox** by adding pages to it or by adding controls by using the **Additional Controls** command from the **[Tools](tools-menu.md)** menu. When you add a page, a **Select Objects** tool is always available on the page.
    
|Button|Icon|Description|
|:-----|:---|:----------|
|**Select Objects**|![Standard toolbox controls](../../../images/tb_pntr_ZA01201663.gif)| **Select Objects** is the only item in the **Toolbox** that doesn't draw a control. When you select it, you can only resize or move a control that has already been drawn on a form.|
|**Label**|![Label](../../../images/tb_label_ZA01201660.gif) |Allows you to have text that you do not want the user to change, such as a caption under a graphic.|
|**TextBox**|![Text box](../../../images/avhtb005_ZA01201581.gif)|Holds text that the user can either enter or change.|
|**ComboBox**|![Combo box](../../../images/avhtb001_ZA01201577.gif) |Allows you to draw a combination list box and text box. The user can either choose an item from the list or enter a value in the text box.|
|**ListBox**|![List box](../../../images/avhtb004_ZA01201580.gif)|Use to display a list of items from which the user can choose. The list can be scrolled if it has more items than can be displayed at one time.|
|**CheckBox**|![Check box](../../../images/tb_chkbx_ZA01201659.gif)|Creates a box that the user can easily choose to indicate if something is true or false, or to display multiple choices when the user can choose more than one.|
|**OptionButton**|![Option button](../../../images/tb_optn_ZA01201662.gif)|Allows you to display multiple choices from which the user can choose only one.|
|**ToggleButton**|![Toggle button](../../../images/tb_togbut_ZA01201666.gif)|Creates a button that toggles on and off.|
|**Frame**|![Frame](../../../images/avhtb002_ZA01201578.gif)|Allows you to create a graphical or functional grouping for controls. To group controls, draw the frame first, and then draw controls inside the frame.|
|**CommandButton**|![Command button](../../../images/tb_buttn_ZA01201658.gif)|Creates a button that the user can choose to carry out a command.|
|**TabStrip**|![Tab strip](../../../images/tb_tabst_ZA01201665.gif)|Allows you to define multiple pages for the same area of a window or dialog box in your application.|
|**MultiPage**|![Multi page](../../../images/tb_multi_ZA01201661.gif)|Presents multiple screens of information as a single set.|
|**ScrollBar**|![Scroll bar](../../../images/tb_vscrl_ZA01201667.gif)|Provides a graphical tool for quickly navigating through a long list of items or a large amount of information, for indicating the current position on a scale, or as an input device or indicator of speed or quantity.|
|**SpinButton**|![Spin button](../../../images/tb_spinb_ZA01201664.gif) |A spinner control that you can use with another control to increment and decrement numbers. You can also use it to scroll back and forth through a range of values or a list of items.|
|**Image**|![Image](../../../images/avhtb003_ZA01201579.gif) |Displays a graphical image from a [bitmap](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#bitmap), [icon](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#icon), or [metafile](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#metafile) on your form. Images displayed in an **Image** control can only be decorative and use fewer resources than a **PictureBox**.|
