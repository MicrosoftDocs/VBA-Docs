# Toolbox


![Toolbox](../../../images/toolbox_ZA01201770.gif)



Displays the standard Visual Basic controls plus any ActiveX controls and insertable objects you have added to your project.




- You can customize the  **Toolbox** by adding pages to it or by adding controls using the **Additional** **Controls** command from the **Tools** menu. When you add a page, a **Select** **Objects** tool is always available on the page.
    


## Standard Toolbox Controls


![Standard toolbox controls](../../../images/tb_pntr_ZA01201663.gif) **Select Objects**

Select Objects is the only item in the  **Toolbox** that doesn't draw a control. When you select it, you can only resize or move a control that has already been drawn on a form.


![Label](../../../images/tb_label_ZA01201660.gif) **Label**

Allows you to have text that you do not want the user to change, such as a caption under a graphic.


![Text box](../../../images/avhtb005_ZA01201581.gif) **TextBox**

Holds text that the user can either enter or change.


![Combo box](../../../images/avhtb001_ZA01201577.gif) **ComboBox**

Allows you to draw a combination list box and text box. The user can either choose an item from the list or enter a value in the text box.


![List box](../../../images/avhtb004_ZA01201580.gif) **ListBox**

Use to display a list of items from which the user can choose. The list can be scrolled if it has more items than can be displayed at one time.


![Check box](../../../images/tb_chkbx_ZA01201659.gif) **CheckBox**

Creates a box that the user can easily choose to indicate if something is true or false, or to display multiple choices when the user can choose more than one.


![Option button](../../../images/tb_optn_ZA01201662.gif) **OptionButton**

Allows you to display multiple choices from which the user can choose only one.


![Toggle button](../../../images/tb_togbut_ZA01201666.gif) **ToggleButton**

Creates a button that toggles on and off.


![Frame](../../../images/avhtb002_ZA01201578.gif) **Frame**

Allows you to create a graphical or functional grouping for controls. To group controls, draw the frame first, and then draw controls inside the frame.


![Command button](../../../images/tb_buttn_ZA01201658.gif) **CommandButton**

Creates a button the user can choose to carry out a command.


![Tab strip](../../../images/tb_tabst_ZA01201665.gif) **TabStrip**

Allows you to define multiple pages for the same area of a window or dialog box in your application.


![Multi page](../../../images/tb_multi_ZA01201661.gif) **MultiPage**

Presents multiple screens of information as a single set.


![Scroll bar](../../../images/tb_vscrl_ZA01201667.gif) **ScrollBar**

Provides a graphical tool for quickly navigating through a long list of items or a large amount of information, for indicating the current position on a scale, or as an input device or indicator of speed or quantity.


![Spin button](../../../images/tb_spinb_ZA01201664.gif) **SpinButton**

A spinner control you can use with another control to increment and decrement numbers. You can also use it to scroll back and forth through a range of values or a list of items.


![Image](../../../images/avhtb003_ZA01201579.gif) **Image**

Displays a graphical image from a [bitmap](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#bitmap), [icon](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#icon), or [metafile](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#metafile) on your form. Images displayed in an **Image** control can only be decorative and use fewer resources than a **PictureBox**.
