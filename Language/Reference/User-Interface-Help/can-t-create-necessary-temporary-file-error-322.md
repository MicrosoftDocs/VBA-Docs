# Can't create necessary temporary file (Error 322)

Creating an [executable file](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#executable-file) requires creation of temporary files. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The drive that contains the directory specified by the TEMP environment variable is full. Delete files from the full drive or specify a different drive in the TEMP environment variable.
    
- The TEMP environment variable specifies an invalid or read-only drive or directory. Specify a valid drive for the TEMP environment variable or remove the read-only restriction from the currently specified drive or directory.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
