# Property let procedure not defined and property get procedure did not return an object (Error 451)

Certain [properties](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#propertie), [methods](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#method), and operations can only apply to  **Collection** objects. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You specified an operation or property that is exclusive to [collections](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#collection), but the object isn't a collection.
    
    Check the spelling of the object or property name, or verify that the object is a  **Collection** object. Also look at the **Add** method used to add the object to the collection to be sure the syntax is correct and that any[identifiers](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#identifier) were spelled correctly.
