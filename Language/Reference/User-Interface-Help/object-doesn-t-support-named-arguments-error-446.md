# Object doesn't support named arguments (Error 446)

- You tried to access an object whose [methods](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#method) don't support named arguments.
    
    Specify [arguments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) positionally when performing methods on this object. See the object's documentation for more information on argument positions and types.
