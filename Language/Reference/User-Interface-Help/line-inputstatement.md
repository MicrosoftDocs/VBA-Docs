# Line Input # Statement

Reads a single line from an open sequential file and assigns it to a [String](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md)[variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable).

## Syntax

**Line Input #**_filenumber_, _varname_

The  **Line Input #** statement syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _filenumber_|Required. Any valid [file number](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#file-number).|
| _varname_|Required. Valid [Variant](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md) or **String** variable name.|

## Remarks

Data read with  **Line Input #** is usually written from a file with **Print #**.
The  **Line Input #** statement reads from a file one character at a time until it encounters a carriage return (**Chr(** 13 **)**) or carriage return-linefeed (**Chr(** 13 **)** + **Chr(** 10 **)**) sequence. Carriage return-linefeed sequences are skipped rather than appended to the character string.

## Example

This example uses the  **Line Input #** statement to read a line from a sequential file and assign it to a variable. This example assumes that is a text file with a few lines of sample data.


```vb
Dim TextLine 
Open "TESTFILE" For Input As #1 ' Open file. 
Do While Not EOF(1) ' Loop until end of file. 
 Line Input #1, TextLine ' Read line into variable. 
 Debug.Print TextLine ' Print to the Immediate window. 
Loop 
Close #1 ' Close file. 

```
