# Unable to activate object (Error 31027)

The object's source document can't be loaded, or the application that created the object isn't available.

This error occurs when you try to activate a linked object (set **Action** = 7) and the file specified in the **SourceDoc** property has been deleted or no longer exists.

This error also occurs when you activate an object (set **Action** = 7), and the action specified by the **Verb** property isn't valid. Some applications that provide objects may support different verbs, depending on the state of the application. All the verbs supported by an application are listed in the **ObjectVerbs** property list. However, some verbs may not be valid for the application's current state.
