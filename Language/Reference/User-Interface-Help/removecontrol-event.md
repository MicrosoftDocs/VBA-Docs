# RemoveControl Event



Occurs when a control is deleted from the [container](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#container).

## Syntax

For MultiPage **Private Sub**_object_ _**RemoveControl(**_index_**As Long**, _ctrl_**As Control)**
For all other controls **Private Sub**_object_ _**RemoveControl(**_ctrl_**As Control)**
The  **RemoveControl** event syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object name.|
| _index_|Required. The index of the page in a  **MultiPage** that contained the deleted control.|
| _ctrl_|Required. The deleted control.|

## Remarks

This event occurs when a control is deleted from the form, not when a control is unloaded due to a form being closed.
