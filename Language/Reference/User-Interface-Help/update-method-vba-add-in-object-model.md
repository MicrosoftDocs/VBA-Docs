# Update Method (VBA Add-In Object Model)



Refreshes the contents of the  **AddIns** collection from the add-ins listed in the Vbaddin.ini file in the same manner as if the user had opened the Add-In Manager dialog box.

## Syntax

_object_. **Update**
The  _object_ placeholder represents an[object expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-expression) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.

## Remarks

All add-ins listed in the Vbaddin.ini file must be registered ActiveX components in the Registry before they can be used in Visual Basic.
