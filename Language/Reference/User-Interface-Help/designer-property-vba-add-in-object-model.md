# Designer Property (VBA Add-In Object Model)



Returns the object that enables you to access the design characteristics of a component.

## Remarks

If the object has an open [designer](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#designer), the  **Designer** property returns the open designer; otherwise a new designer is created. The designer is a characteristic of certain **VBComponent** objects. For example, when you create certain types of **VBComponent** object, a designer is created along with the object. A component can have only one designer, and it's always the same designer. The **Designer** property enables you to access a component-specific object. In some cases, such as in[standard modules](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#standard-module) and[class modules](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#class-module), a designer isn't created because that type of  **VBComponent** object doesn't support a designer.
The  **Designer** property returns **Nothing** if the **VBComponent** object doesn't have a designer.
