# A procedure with a ParamArray argument cannot be called with named arguments

All [arguments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) in a call to a[procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) defined with a **ParamArray** must be positional. This error has the following cause and solution:


- [Named-argument](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#named-argument) syntax appears in a procedure call.
    
    The named-argument calling syntax can't be used to call a procedure that includes a  **ParamArray** parameter. To supply only some elements of the **ParamArray**, use commas as placeholders for those elements you want to omit. For example, in the following call, if the **ParamArray** arguments begin after `Arg2`, values are being passed only for the first, third, and sixth values in the  **ParamArray**:
    


  ```vb
  MySub Arg1, Arg2, 7,, 44,,,3 
  ```


     **Note**  The  **ParamArray** always represents the last items in the argument list.

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
