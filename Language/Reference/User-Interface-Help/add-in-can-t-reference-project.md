# Add-in can't reference project

[Projects](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) are dynamic, but[add-ins](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#add-in) are static. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to create an add-in from a [project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) that references another project.
    
    The semantics of projects can change in a way that affects referencing projects and add-ins. Therefore, you can't create an add-in from a project that references projects.
