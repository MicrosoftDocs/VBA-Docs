# Statements or labels invalid between Select Case and first Case

You can place nothing but a [comment](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#comment) between the **Select Case** statement and the first **Case** clause. This error has the following cause and solution:

- You placed a statement between **Select Case** and its first **Case** clause. For example:
    
  ```vb
      Select Case SomeVar 
    ' This is a comment and is valid. 
    Stop ' Even a Stop statement is invalid here. 
    Case SomeValue 
    . . . 
    End Select 
  ```

  The **Select Case** statement must be immediately followed by its first **Case** statement. If the intervening [expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#expression) is a comment, precede it with a comment delimiter (**'**). Otherwise, place the expression where it belongs or delete it.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
