# Move method (FileSystemObject)

Moves a specified file or folder from one location to another.

## Syntax

_object_.**Move** _destination_

<br/>

The **Move** method syntax has these parts:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. Always the name of a **[File](file-object.md)** or **[Folder](folder-object.md)** object.|
| _destination_|Required. Destination where the file or folder is to be moved. Wildcard characters are not allowed.|

## Remarks

The results of the **Move** method on a **File** or **Folder** are identical to operations performed by using **FileSystemObject.MoveFile** or **FileSystemObject.MoveFolder**. You should note, however, that the alternative methods are capable of moving multiple files or folders.
