# Remove Method



Removes a member from a [collection](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#collection); or, removes a control from a  **Frame**, **Page**, or form.

## Syntax

_object_. **Remove(**_collectionindex_**)**
The  **Remove** method syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _collectionindex_|Required. A member's position, or index, within a collection. Numeric as well as string values are acceptable. If the value is a number, the minimum value is zero, and the maximum value is one less than the number of members in the collection. If the value is a string, it must correspond to a valid member name.|

## Remarks

This method deletes any control that was added at [run time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#run-time). However, attempting to delete a control that was added at [design time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#design-time) will result in an error.
