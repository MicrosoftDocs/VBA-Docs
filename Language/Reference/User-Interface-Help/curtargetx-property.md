# CurTargetX Property



Retrieves the preferred horizontal position of the insertion point in a multiline  **TextBox** or **ComboBox**.

## Syntax

_object_. **CurTargetX**
The  **CurTargetX** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|

 **Return Values**
The  **CurTargetX** property retrieves the preferred position, measured in himetric units. A himetric is 0.0001 meter.

## Remarks

The [target](../../Glossary/glossary-vba.md#target) position is relative to the left edge of the control. If the length of a line is less than the value of the **CurTargetX** property, you can place the insertion point at the end of the the line. The value of **CurTargetX** changes when the user sets the insertion point or when the **CurX** property is set. **CurTargetX** is read-only.
The return value is valid when the object has [focus](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#focus).
You can use  **CurTargetX** and **CurX** to move the insertion point as the user scrolls through the contents of a multiline **TextBox** or **ComboBox**. When the user moves the insertion point to another line of text by scrolling the content of the object, **CurTargetX** specifies the preferred position for the insertion point. **CurX** is set to this value if the line of text is longer than the value of **CurTargetX**. Otherwise, **CurX** is set to the end of the line of text.
