# UserForm window 

![Userform window](../../../images/userform_ZA01201773.gif)

Allows you to create the windows or dialog boxes in your project. You draw and view [controls](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#control) on a [form](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#form).

While you are designing a form:

- Each form window has a **Maximize**, **Minimize**, and **Close** button.
    
- You can view the form grid and determine the size of the gridlines on the **General** tab of the **[Options](options-dialog-box.md)** dialog box.
    
- Use the buttons in the Toolbox to draw controls on the form. You can set your controls to align with the grid of your form on the **General** tab of the **Options** dialog box.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Use these key combinations in the UserForm window. To deselect all controls, click the form. To select controls in a container, first deselect the container and then use CTRL+CLICK+DRAG around the desired controls.
