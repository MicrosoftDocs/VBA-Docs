# Event handler is invalid

The [parameter](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#parameter) list of an event-handling[procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) must precisely match the declaration of the event. This error has the following cause and solution:



- Your event-handling procedure has the wrong number of parameters. Eliminate extra parameters or add the missing ones.
    
- One or more of your event-handling procedure parameters has the wrong [data type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#data-type).
    
    Make the parameter types match those of the event declaration.
    
- Your event-handling procedure is a  **Function** rather than a **Sub**. Make your procedure a **Sub**. An event handler can't return a value.
    
- Another [type library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-library) uses the event name for a type of its own.
    
    Qualify the name with the name of the proper type library to avoid the ambiguity.
