# Object library's language setting incompatible with current project

The reference couldn't be added. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You attempted to add a reference to an [object library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-library) whose[locale](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#locale) isn't compatible with the locale of the current[project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project). The reference was not added. To use that object library, a project whose locale is compatible with it must be created.
    
    Try registering both Visual Basic for Applications and the [host application](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#host-application) for the given language. The object library then becomes available in the **References** dialog box.
    
     **Note**  When Visual Basic is the host application, it isn't possible to change a project's language setting. Any object libraries used must be compatible with the English/U.S. setting.
