# References Command (Tools Menu)

Displays the  **References** dialog box. This dialog box allows you to add an[object library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-library) or[type library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-library) reference to your project. This makes another application's objects available in your code. Once a reference is set, the referenced objects are displayed in the[Object Browser](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Object-Browser).

You can also add references to other loaded and saved projects. If a project has not been saved, it appears as "UNSAVED: <ProjectName>" and you will be unable to make a reference to it.

Only available at [design time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#design-time).
