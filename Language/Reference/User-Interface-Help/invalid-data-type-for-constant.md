# Invalid data type for constant

Not all types of data can be assigned to [constants](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#constant). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to declare the type of a constant to be a [user-defined type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#user-defined-type), an object, or an [array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array).
    
    Remove the declaration or redeclare as a [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable).
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
