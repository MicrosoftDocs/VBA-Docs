# Description Property (Visual Basic for Applications)



Returns or sets a [string expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#string-expression) containing a descriptive string associated with an object. Read/write.
For the  **Err** object, returns or sets a descriptive string associated with an error.

## Remarks

The  **Description** property setting consists of a short description of the error. Use this[property](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) to alert the user to an error that you either can't or don't want to handle. When generating a user-defined error, assign a short description of your error to the **Description** property. If **Description** isn't filled in, and the value of **Number** corresponds to a Visual Basic[run-time error](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#run-time-error), the string returned by the  **Error** function is placed in **Description** when the error is generated.

## Example

This example assigns a user-defined message to the  **Description** property of the **Err** object.


```vb
Err. Description = "It was not possible to access an object necessary " _
& "for this operation."

```
