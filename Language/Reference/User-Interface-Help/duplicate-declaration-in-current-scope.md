# Duplicate declaration in current scope

The specified name is already used at this level of [scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope). For example, two [variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) can have the same name if they are defined in different [procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure), but not if they are defined within the same procedure. This error has the following causes and solutions:

- A new variable or procedure has the same name as an existing variable or procedure. For example:
    
  ```vb
    Sub MySub() 
    Dim A As Integer 
    Dim A As Variant 
    . . .        ' Other declarations or procedure code here. 
    End Sub
  ```

  Check the current procedure, [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module), or [project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) and remove any duplicate declarations.
    
- A **Const** statement uses the same name as an existing variable or procedure. Remove or rename the[constant](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#constant) in question.
    
- You declared a fixed [array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array) more than once.
    
  Remove or rename one of the arrays.
    

Search for the duplicate name. When specifying the name to search for, omit any [type-declaration character](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-declaration-character) because a conflict occurs if the names are the same and the type-declaration characters are different.

Note that a [module-level](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module-level) variable can have the same name as a variable declared in a procedure, but when you want to refer to the module-level variable within the procedure, you must qualify it with the module name. Module names and the names of [referenced projects](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#referenced-project) can be reused as variable names within procedures and can also be qualified.
