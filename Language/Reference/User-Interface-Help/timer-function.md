# Timer function

Returns a **Single** representing the number of seconds elapsed since midnight.

## Syntax

**Timer**

## Remarks

In Windows, the **Timer** function returns fractional portions of a second. On the Macintosh, timer resolution is one second.

## Example

This example uses the **Timer** function to pause the application. The example also uses **[DoEvents](doevents-function.md)** to yield to other processes during the pause.


```vb
Dim PauseTime, Start, Finish, TotalTime
If (MsgBox("Press Yes to pause for 5 seconds", 4)) = vbYes Then
    PauseTime = 5    ' Set duration.
    Start = Timer    ' Set start time.
    Do While Timer < Start + PauseTime
        DoEvents    ' Yield to other processes.
    Loop
    Finish = Timer    ' Set end time.
    TotalTime = Finish - Start    ' Calculate total time.
    MsgBox "Paused for " & TotalTime & " seconds"
Else
    End
End If

```
