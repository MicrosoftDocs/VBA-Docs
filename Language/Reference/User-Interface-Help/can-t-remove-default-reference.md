# Can't remove default reference

A default reference always exists. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to remove a reference that must always be available, for example, a [type-library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-library) or[object-library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-library) reference.
    
    Don't attempt to remove the reference.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
