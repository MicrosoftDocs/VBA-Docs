# Error in loading DLL (Error 48)

A [dynamic link library (DLL)](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#dynamic-link-library-dll) is a library specified in the **Lib** clause of a **Declare** statement. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- The file isn't DLL-executable. If the file is a source-text file, it must be compiled and linked to DLL executable form.
    
- The file isn't a Microsoft Windows DLL. Obtain the Microsoft Windows DLL equivalent of the file.
    
- The file is an early Microsoft Windows DLL that is incompatible with Microsoft Windows protect mode. Obtain an updated version of the DLL.
    
- The DLL references another DLL that isn't present. Obtain the referenced DLL and make it available to the other DLL.
    
- The DLL or one of the referenced DLLs isn't in a directory specified by your path. Move the DLL to a referenced directory or place its current directory on the path.
