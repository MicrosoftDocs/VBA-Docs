# Constant expression required

A [constant](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#constant) must be initialized. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to initialize a constant with a [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable), an instance of a [user-defined type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#user-defined-type), an object, or the return value of a function call.
    
    Initialize constants with literals, previously declared constants, or literals and constants joined by operators (except the  **Is** logical operator).
    
- [array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array)
    
    To declare a dynamic array within a [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure), declare the array with  **ReDim** and specify the number of elements with a variable.
