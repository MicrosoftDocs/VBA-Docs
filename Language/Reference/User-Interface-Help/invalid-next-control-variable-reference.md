# Invalid Next control variable reference

The numeric [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) in the **Next** part of a **For...Next** loop must match the variable in the **For** part. This error has the following cause and solution:

- The variable in the **Next** part of a **For...Next** loop differs from the variable in the **For** part. For example:
    
  ```vb
    For Counter = 1 To 10 
    MyVar = Counter 
    Next Count 
  ```

  Check the spelling of the variable in the **Next** part to be sure it matches the **For** part. Also, be sure you haven't inadvertently deleted parts of the enclosing loop that used the variable.
