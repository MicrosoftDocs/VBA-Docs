# FileDateTime Function



Returns a  **Variant** (**Date**) that indicates the date and time when a file was created or last modified.

## Syntax

**FileDateTime(**_pathname_**)**
The required  _pathname_[argument](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) is a[string expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#string-expression) that specifies a file name. The _pathname_ may include the directory or folder, and the drive.

## Example

This example uses the  **FileDateTime** function to determine the date and time a file was created or last modified. The format of the date and time displayed is based on the locale settings of your system.


```vb
Dim MyStamp
' Assume TESTFILE was last modified on February 12, 1993 at 4:35:47 PM.
' Assume English/U.S. locale settings.
MyStamp = FileDateTime("TESTFILE")    ' Returns "2/12/93 4:35:47 PM".


```
