# Selected watch expression invalid

It isn't always possible to select a valid [watch expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#watch-expression). This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You chose the  **Instant Watch** command, but the selected[expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#expression) isn't a valid expression. For example, you can't watch a[comment](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#comment) or a **Sub** procedure call.
    
    Select the expression in such a way that it is valid, or choose  **Add Watch** and type in a valid expression.
    
- The watch expression must have code syntax corresponding to the [locale](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#locale) of the[project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) that defines the expression being watched.
    
    Rewrite the expression in a way that is valid for the locale.
