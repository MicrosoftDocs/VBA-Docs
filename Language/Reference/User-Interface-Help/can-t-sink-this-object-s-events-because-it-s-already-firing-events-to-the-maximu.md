# Can't sink this object's events because it's already firing events to the maximum number of supported event recipients (Error 96)

Each object specifies the maximum number of simultaneous recipients to which it can fire events. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to use **Set** for a **WithEvents** variable for a control on a form. You can't use **Set** for a **WithEvents** variable because the number of recipients allowed for these events.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
