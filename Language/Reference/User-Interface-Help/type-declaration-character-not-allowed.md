# Type-declaration character not allowed

While using [type-declaration characters](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-declaration-character) is valid in Visual Basic, some [data types](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#data-type) (including **Byte**, **Boolean**, **Date**, **Object**, and **Variant**) have no associated type-declaration characters. This error has the following causes and solutions:

- You tried to use a type-declaration character in the declaration of a [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) that uses the **As** clause, for example, with **Dim**, **Static**, **Public**, and so on.
    
  Either remove the type-declaration character or remove the **As** clause.
    
- You tried to use a [type-declaration character](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-declaration-character) in reference to a variable that was implicitly declared without a type-declaration character:
    
  ```vb
      MyVar = 20    ' Implicit declaration. 
      MyVar% = 25   ' Generates an error. 
  ```

  ```vb
    Dim MyStr$  
    MyStr = "Because it was explicitly declared, the $ is optional." 
  ```

  Either remove the type-declaration character or redeclare the original variable.
    
  > [!NOTE] 
  > If an explicit variable declaration contains a type-declaration character, inclusion of the character is optional in later references.
