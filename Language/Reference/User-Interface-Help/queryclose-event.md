# QueryClose Event



Occurs before a  **UserForm** closes.

## Syntax

**Private Sub UserForm_QueryClose(**_cancel_**As Integer**, _closemode_**As Integer)**
The  **QueryClose** event syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _cancel_|An integer. Setting this [argument](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) to any value other than 0 stops the QueryClose event in all loaded user forms and prevents the **UserForm** and application from closing.|
| _closemode_|A value or [constant](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#constant) indicating the cause of the QueryClose event.|

 **Return Values**
The  _closemode_ argument returns the following values:


|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**vbFormControlMenu**|0|The user has chosen the  **Close** command from the **Control** menu on the **UserForm**.|
|**vbFormCode**|1|The  **Unload** statement is invoked from code.|
|**vbAppWindows**|2|The current Windows operating environment session is ending.|
|**vbAppTaskManager**|3|The Windows  **Task Manager** is closing the application.|

These constants are listed in the Visual Basic for Applications [object library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-library) in the[Object Browser](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Object-Browser). Note that  **vbFormMDIForm** is also specified in the **Object Browser**, but is not yet supported.

## Remarks

This event is typically used to make sure there are no unfinished tasks in the user forms included in an application before that application closes. For example, if a user hasn't saved new data in any  **UserForm**, the application can prompt the user to save the data.
When an application closes, you can use the  **QueryClose** event procedure to set the **Cancel** property to **True**, stopping the closing process.

## Example

The following code forces the user to click the  **UserForm's** client area to close it. If the user tries to use the **Close** box in the title bar, the _Cancel_ parameter is set to a nonzero value, preventing termination. However, if the user has clicked the client area, _CloseMode_ has the value 1 and `Unload Me` is executed.


```vb
Private Sub UserForm_Activate()
    UserForm1.Caption = "You must Click me to kill me!"
End Sub

Private Sub UserForm_Click()
  Unload Me
End Sub

Private Sub UserForm_QueryClose(Cancel As Integer, CloseMode As Integer)
    'Prevent user from closing with the Close box in the title bar.
    If CloseMode <> 1 Then Cancel = 1
    UserForm1.Caption = "The Close box won't work! Click me!"
End Sub
```
