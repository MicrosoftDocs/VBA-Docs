- Major — Major release number of the project; 0 - 9999.
    
- Minor — Minor release number of the project; 0 - 9999.
    
- Revision — Revision version number of the project; 0-9999.
    
- Auto Increment — If selected, automatically increases the Revision number by one each time you run the  **Make** **Project** command for this project.
    


 **Version Information**

Lets you provide specific information about the current version of your project.




- Type — Information you can use to set a value. You can enter information for your company name, file description, legal copyright, legal trademarks, product name and comments.
    
- Value — The value for the type of information selected in the Type box.
    


 **DLL Base Address**

Allows you to set the base address

 **Remove information about unused ActiveX Controls**

Allows you to specify that even if a control is unused (present in the  **Toolbox**, but not referenced in code), its information will be retained. Uncheck this when you plan to dynamically add the referenced control at run time using the **Controls** collection's **Add** method.
