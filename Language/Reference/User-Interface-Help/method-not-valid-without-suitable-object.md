# Method not valid without suitable object

Not all [methods](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#method) can be performed by all objects. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You called a method without specifying an object, and the method isn't valid for the implicit object. For example, you can't use the  **Line** method in a[standard module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#standard-module) without a valid object qualifier because a standard module can't display the output of the **Line** method.
    
    Explicitly qualify the method call with an object that can accept the method. For example, you can specify a form or picture box with the  **Line** method.
    
     **Note**  Other methods that need an explicit object qualifier when used in a standard module include  **Circle**, **Print**, and **PSet**.
