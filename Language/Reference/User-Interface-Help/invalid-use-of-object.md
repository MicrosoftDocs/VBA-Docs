# Invalid use of object

You tried to use an object in an incorrect way. This error has the following causes and solutions:

- You tried to discontinue an object reference by assigning **Nothing** to it but omitted the **Set** [keyword](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#keyword):
    
  ```vb
    MyObject = Nothing 
  ```

  Use the **Set** statement to set an object to **Nothing**. Assuming `MyObject` is an object, you must set it to **Nothing** with the **Set** statement:
    
  ```vb
    Set MyObject = Nothing 
  ```

  Omitting the **Set** keyword is an implicit use of **Let**, which causes an attempt to perform a value assignment, rather than a reference assignment. **Nothing** can't be used in a value assignment.
    
- You attempted to use Nothing in an [expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#expression).
    
  Rewrite the expression without the **Nothing**.
