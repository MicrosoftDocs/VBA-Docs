# Can't execute code in break mode

You enter [break mode](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#break-mode) when you suspend execution of code. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to run code from the  **Macro** dialog box. However, Visual Basic was already running code, although the code was suspended in break mode. You may have entered break mode without knowing it, for example, if a[syntax error](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#syntax-error) or[run-time error](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#run-time-error) occurred. Continue running the suspended code, or terminate its execution before you run code from the **Macro** dialog box. You can fix the error and choose **Continue**, or you can return to the **Macro** dialog box and restart the macro.
