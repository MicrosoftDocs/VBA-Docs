# Member identifier already exists in object module from which this object module derives

[Identifiers](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Identifier) used for object module members can't conflict with names already used in an [object module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-module) from which they derive. This error has the following cause and solution:

- A [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) or data member identifier in your object module uses an identifier already used in the object module from which it derives. For example, a form has a **BackColor** property, so the following code would cause this error:
    
  ```vb
      ' Form already has a BackColor property. 
    Dim BackColor As Integer    ' Generates the error. 
    
    Function BackColor()    ' Generates the error. 
    End Function
  ```

  Change the identifier that conflicts with the member identifier in your object module.
    
  > [!NOTE] 
  > The following names cannot be used as property or method names because they belong to the underlying **IUnknown** and **IDispatch** interfaces: **QueryInterface**, **AddRef**, **Release**, **GetTypeInfoCount**, **GetTypeInfo**, **GetIDsOfNames**, **Invoke**. Using these names causes a compilation error.
