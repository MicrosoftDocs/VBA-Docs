# LayoutEffect property

Specifies whether a control was moved during a layout change.

## Syntax

_object_.**LayoutEffect**

The **LayoutEffect** property syntax has these parts:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|

## Return values

The **LayoutEffect** property return values are:

|Constant|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _fmLayoutEffectNone_|0|The control was not moved.|
| _fmLayoutEffectInitiate_|1|The control moved.|

## Remarks

The **LayoutEffect** property is read-only and is available only in the Layout event. The Layout event is initiated by the **Move** method if the _Layout_ argument is **True**.

The Layout event is not initiated when you change the settings of the **Left**, **Top**, **Height**, or **Width** properties of a control.

The Layout event sets **LayoutEffect** for any control that was involved in a move operation. For example, if you move a group of controls, **LayoutEffect** of each control is set.
