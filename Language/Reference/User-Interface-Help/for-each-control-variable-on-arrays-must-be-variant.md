# For Each control variable on arrays must be Variant

A control [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) is the _element_ part of the **For Each...Next** statement syntax. This error has the following cause and solution:



- An [array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array) has a control variable that isn't a **Variant**.
    
    Make sure the  _group_ part of the **For Each...Next** is a **Variant** type variable.
    
- For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
