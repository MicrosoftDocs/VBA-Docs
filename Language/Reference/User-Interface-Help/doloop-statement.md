# Do...Loop statement

Repeats a block of [statements](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#statement) while a condition is **True** or until a condition becomes **True**.

## Syntax

**Do** [{ **While** | **Until** } _condition_ ] <br/>
[ _statements_ ] <br/>
[ **Exit Do** ] <br/>
[ _statements_ ] <br/>
**Loop**

Or, you can use this syntax:

**Do** <br/>
[ _statements_ ] <br/>
[ **Exit Do** ] <br/>
[ _statements_ ] <br/>
**Loop** [{ **While** | **Until** } _condition_ ]

<br/>

The **Do Loop** statement syntax has these parts:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _condition_|Optional. [Numeric expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#numeric-expression) or [string expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#string-expression) that is **True** or **False**. If _condition_ is [Null](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#null),  _condition_ is treated as **False**.|
| _statements_|One or more statements that are repeated while, or until,  _condition_ is **True**.|

## Remarks

Any number of **[Exit Do](exit-statement.md)** statements may be placed anywhere in the **Do…Loop** as an alternate way to exit a **Do…Loop**. **Exit Do** is often used after evaluating some condition, for example, **If…Then**, in which case the **Exit Do** statement transfers control to the statement immediately following the **Loop**.

When used within nested **Do…Loop** statements, **Exit Do** transfers control to the loop that is one nested level above the loop where **Exit Do** occurs.

## Example

This example shows how **Do...Loop** statements can be used. The inner **Do...Loop** statement loops 10 times, asks the user if it should keep going, sets the value of the flag to **False** when they select **No**, and exits prematurely by using the **Exit Do** statement. The outer loop exits immediately upon checking the value of the flag.


```vb
Public Sub LoopExample()
    Dim Check As Boolean, Counter As Long, Total As Long
    Check = True: Counter = 0: Total = 0 ' Initalize variables.
    Do ' Outer loop.
        Do While Counter < 20 ' Inner Loop
            Counter = Counter + 1 ' Increment Counter.
            If Counter Mod 10 = 0 Then ' Check in with the user on every multiple of 10.
                Check = (MsgBox("Keep going?", vbYesNo) = vbYes) ' Stop when user click's on No
                If Not Check Then Exit Do ' Exit inner loop.
            End If
        Loop
        Total = Total + Counter ' Exit Do Lands here.
        Counter = 0
    Loop Until Check = False ' Exit outer loop immediately.
    MsgBox "Counted to: " & Total
End Sub
```
