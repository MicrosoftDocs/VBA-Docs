# Currency Data Type

[Currency variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md) are stored as 64-bit (8-byte) numbers in an integer format, scaled by 10,000 to give a fixed-point number with 15 digits to the left of the decimal point and 4 digits to the right. This representation provides a range of -922,337,203,685,477.5808 to 922,337,203,685,477.5807. The[type-declaration character](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-declaration-character) for **Currency** is the at sign (**@**).

The  **Currency**[data type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#data-type) is useful for calculations involving money and for fixed-point calculations in which accuracy is particularly important.
