# CopyFolder method

Recursively copies a folder from one location to another.

## Syntax

_object_.**CopyFolder** _source_, _destination_, [ _overwrite_ ]

<br/>

The **CopyFolder** method syntax has these parts:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. Always the name of a **[FileSystemObject](filesystemobject-object.md)**.|
| _source_|Required. Character string folder specification, which can include wildcard characters, for one or more folders to be copied.|
| _destination_|Required. Character string destination where the folder and subfolders from _source_ are to be copied. Wildcard characters are not allowed.|
| _overwrite_|Optional. **Boolean** value that indicates if existing folders are to be overwritten. If **True**, files are overwritten; if **False**, they are not. The default is **True**.|

## Remarks

Wildcard characters can only be used in the last path component of the _source_ argument. For example, you can use:

```vb
FileSystemObject.CopyFolder "c:\mydocuments\letters\*", "c:\tempfolder\"

```

But you can't use:

```vb
FileSystemObject.CopyFolder "c:\mydocuments\*\*", "c:\tempfolder\"

```

If _source_ contains wildcard characters, or _destination_ ends with a path separator (\), it is assumed that _destination_ is an existing folder in which to copy matching folders and subfolders. Otherwise, _destination_ is assumed to be the name of a folder to create. In either case, four things can happen when an individual folder is copied:

- If _destination_ does not exist, the _source_ folder and all its contents gets copied. This is the usual case.
    
- If _destination_ is an existing file, an error occurs.
    
- If _destination_ is a directory, an attempt is made to copy the folder and all its contents. If a file contained in _source_ already exists in _destination_, an error occurs if _overwrite_ is **False**. Otherwise, it will attempt to copy the file over the existing file.
    
- If _destination_ is a read-only directory, an error occurs if an attempt is made to copy an existing read-only file into that directory and _overwrite_ is **False**.
    
An error also occurs if a _source_ using wildcard characters doesn't match any folders.

The **CopyFolder** method stops on the first error it encounters. No attempt is made to roll back any changes made before an error occurs.
