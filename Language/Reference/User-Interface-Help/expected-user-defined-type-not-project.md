# Expected user-defined type, not project

There is no [user-defined type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#user-defined-type) by this name in the current[scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope), but there is a [project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) by this name. You can define a[variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) as having user-defined type, but not project type. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The name of a project is used as a user-defined type. Check the spelling of the name of the user-defined type, and make sure the user-defined type isn't private to another [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module).
