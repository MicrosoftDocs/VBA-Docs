# Property or method not found (Error 423)

The spelling of an object name must exactly match the definition in its [object library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-library). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You referred to an  _object_. _method_ or _object_. _property_, but _method_ or _property_ isn't defined. You may have misspelled the name of the _object_. To see what[properties](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#propertie) and[methods](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#method) are defined for an _object_, display the[Object Browser](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Object-Browser). Select the appropriate object library to view a list of available properties and methods.
