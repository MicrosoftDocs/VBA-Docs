# Type-declaration character does not match declared data type

The [data type](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#data-type) of a[variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) can't be changed by appending the[type-declaration character](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-declaration-character) for another type. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You declared a variable of a specific type, referenced a variable of the same name in the same [scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope), and then appended an inconsistent type-declaration character.
    
    If you want to be able to change the type of data assigned to a variable, declare the variable as a  **Variant**. If you simply appended an incorrect type-declaration character, delete or change it.
