# Expected: <various>

An expected part of the syntax was not found. The error is usually located to the left of the selected item, but isn't always obvious. For example, you can invoke a **Sub** procedure with or without the **Call** keyword. However, if you use the **Call** keyword, you must enclose the argument list in parentheses. This error has the following causes and solutions:

- **Expected: End of Statement**. Improper use of parentheses in a [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) invocation:
    
  ```vb
    X = Workbook.Add F:= 5    ' Error due to no parentheses. 
    Call MySub 5                ' Error due to no parentheses. 
  ```

  Use parentheses in a function call that specifies [arguments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) or with a **Sub** procedure invocation that uses the **Call** keyword.
    
- **Expected: )**. Incorrect syntax for a procedure call. For example, a function call can't stand by itself, and **Sub** procedure calls sometimes require the **Call** keyword, depending on how you specify their arguments.
    
  ```vb
      Workbook.Add (X:=5, Y:=7)    ' Function call without expression. 
      YourSub(5, 7)                ' Sub invocation without Call. 
  ```

  Always use function calls in [expressions](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#expression). If you have multiple arguments enclosed in parentheses in a **Sub** procedure call, you must use the **Call** keyword.
    
- **Expected: Expression**. For example, when pasting code from the [Object Browser](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Object-Browser), you may have forgotten to specify a value for a [named argument](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#named-argument).
    
  ```vb
    Workbook.Add (X:= )  ' Error because no value assigned to ' named argument. 
  ```

  Either add a value for the argument, or delete the argument if it's optional.
    
- **Expected: Variable**. For example, you may have used restricted [keywords](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#keyword) for variable names. In the following example, the **Input #** statement expects a variable as the second argument. Since **Type** is a restricted keyword, it can't be used as a variable name.
    
  ```vb
    Input # 1, Type    ' Type keyword invalidly used as ' variable name. 
  ```

  Rename the variable so it doesn't conflict with restricted keywords.
