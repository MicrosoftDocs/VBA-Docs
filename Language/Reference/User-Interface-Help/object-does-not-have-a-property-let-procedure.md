# Object does not have a Property Let procedure

You can't assign a value to a [property](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#property) unless it has exposed a **Property Let** method. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to assign a value to a property that hasn't exposed a  **Property Let** method. You can't directly assign a value to this property. If you created the[class](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#class), you can modify the interface by exposing a  **Property Let** method. Otherwise, check the component's documentation to determine if there is an indirect method for assigning the value.
