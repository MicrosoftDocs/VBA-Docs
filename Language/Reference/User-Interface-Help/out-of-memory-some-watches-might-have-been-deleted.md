# Out of memory; some watches might have been deleted

When your system runs out of memory, [watch expressions](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#watch-expression) are deleted to make enough memory available to permit recovery from the condition. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You have too many [applications](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#application), [projects](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project), or [modules](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module) loaded.
    
    To continue working, remove any dispensable elements from memory, including unnecessary applications, projects, or modules that may be loaded.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
