# Only comments may appear after End Sub, End Function, or End Property

Only [comments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#comment), directives, and [declarations](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#declaration) are permitted outside[procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You placed executable code outside a procedure. Any nondeclarative lines outside a procedure must begin with a comment delimiter (**'**). Declarative statements must appear before the first procedure declaration. Comments are ignored when the code executes.
