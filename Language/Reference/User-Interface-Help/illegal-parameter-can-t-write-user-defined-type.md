# Illegal parameter. Can't write user-defined type.

This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You've attempted to write a user-defined type to a PropertyBag object, which is not supported. To work around this, you can write each individual item of the user-defined type to the PropertyBag object.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
