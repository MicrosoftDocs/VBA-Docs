# Range has no values

There are limitations on the way you can specify the number of elements in an [array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array). This error has the following cause and solution:

- You specified your array boundaries incorrectly. For example, the following ranges are invalid:
    
  ```vb
    Dim MyArray(10 To -5)    ' Descending order not permitted. 
    Dim MyArray(0 To 0)        ' No elements in the array. 
  ```

  Check to be sure your syntax is correct. For example, the following range is valid:
    
  ```vb
    Dim MyArray(-5 To 10)
  ```
