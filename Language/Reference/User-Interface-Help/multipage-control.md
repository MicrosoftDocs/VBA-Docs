# MultiPage Control



Presents multiple screens of information as a single set.

## Remarks

A  **MultiPage** is useful when you work with a large amount of information that can be sorted into several categories. For example, use a **MultiPage** to display information from an employment application. One page might contain personal information such as name and address; another page might list previous employers; a third page might list references. The **MultiPage** lets you visually combine related information, while keeping the entire record readily accessible.
New pages are added to the right of the currently selected page rather than adjacent to it.

 **Note**  The  **MultiPage** is a[container](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#container) of a **Pages** collection, each of which contains one or more **Page** objects.

The default property for a  **MultiPage** is the **Value** property, which returns the index of the currently active **Page** in the **Pages** collection of the **MultiPage**.
The default event for a  **MultiPage** is the Change event.
