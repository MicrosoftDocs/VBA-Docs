# Initialize Event



Occurs after an object is loaded, but before it's shown.

## Syntax

**Private Sub**_object_**_Initialize()**
The  _object_ placeholder represents an[object expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-expression) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.

## Remarks

The Initialize event is typically used to prepare an application or  **UserForm** for use.[Variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) are assigned initial values, and controls may be moved or resized to accommodate initialization data.

## Example

The following example assumes two  **UserForms** in a program. In UserForm1's Initialize event, UserForm2 is loaded and shown. When the user clicks UserForm2, it is hidden and UserForm1 appears. When UserForm1 is clicked, UserForm2 is shown again.


```vb
' This is the Initialize event procedure for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
    Load UserForm2
    UserForm2.Show
End Sub
' This is the Click event of UserForm2
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    UserForm2.Hide
End Sub

' This is the click event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    UserForm2.Show
End Sub
```
