# Expected variable or procedure, not project

There is no [variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) or [procedure](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) by this name in the current[scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope), but there is a [project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) by this name. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The name of a project is used as a variable or procedure. Check the spelling of the variable or procedure name, and make sure the name you want to refer to isn't private to another [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module). A project name can be a qualifier, but can't stand alone.
