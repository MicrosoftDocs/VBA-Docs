# Invalid in Immediate window

Not all statements are permitted in the  **Immediate** window. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- A declarative statement was used. For example,  **Const**, **Declare**, **Def**_type_, **Dim**, **Function**, **Option Base**, **Option Explicit**, **Option Compare**, **Option Private**, **Private**, **Public**, property procedure declaration statements (**Property Let**, **Property Set**, and **Property Get**), **ReDim**, **Static**, **Sub**, and **Type** are not allowed in the **Immediate** window. Remove the declarative statements from the **Immediate** window.
    
- A control flow statement was used, for example,  **Sub**, **Function**, **Property**, **GoSub**, **GoTo**, **Return**, and **Resume**. Remove these statements from the **Immediate** window.
    
- There is no logical connection made between separated physical lines in the  **Immediate** window, so statements formatted as multiple physical lines, such as a block **If** statement, can't be properly executed. Such blocks can be typed on a single physical line, with each statement separated from the next by a colon (**:**). Conversely, you can extend a single statement across physical lines in the **Immediate** window by using the[line-continuation character](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#line-continuation-character), which is a space followed by an underscore (  **_**).
    
- You tried to execute some code in the  **Immediate** window that invalidates the current state of your program and requires you to reinitialize the program. Remove the code in question from the **Immediate** window.
