# MoveFile method

Moves one or more files from one location to another.

## Syntax

_object_.**MoveFile** _source_, _destination_

The **MoveFile** method syntax has these parts:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. Always the name of a **[FileSystemObject](filesystemobject-object.md)**.|
| _source_|Required. The path to the file or files to be moved. The _source_ argument string can contain wildcard characters in the last path component only.|
| _destination_|Required. The path where the file or files are to be moved. The _destination_ argument can't contain wildcard characters.|

## Remarks

If _source_ contains wildcards or _destination_ ends with a path separator (**\**), it is assumed that _destination_ specifies an existing folder in which to move the matching files. Otherwise, _destination_ is assumed to be the name of a destination file to create. In either case, three things can happen when an individual file is moved:

- If _destination_ does not exist, the file gets moved. This is the usual case.
    
- If _destination_ is an existing file, an error occurs.
    
- If _destination_ is a directory, an error occurs.
    
An error also occurs if a wildcard character that is used in _source_ doesn't match any files. The **MoveFile** method stops on the first error it encounters. No attempt is made to roll back any changes made before the error occurs.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This method allows moving files between volumes only if supported by the operating system.
