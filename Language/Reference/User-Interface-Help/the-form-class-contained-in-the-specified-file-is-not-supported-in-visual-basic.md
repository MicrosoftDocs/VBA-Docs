# The form class contained in the specified file is not supported in Visual Basic for Applications; the file can't be loaded.

Visual Basic for Applications only supports  **UserForm** form objects. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You are trying to load a form from an earlier version of Visual Basic or a form from a current standalone version of Visual Basic. It is probably easiest to redesign the form using the  **UserForm** tools within Visual Basic for Applications. If you can save the form in[ASCII](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#ASCII) format, you may be able to modify the form and import it. However, you must completely understand the formats and limitations of the various form packages.
