# Line 'item1': Can't create embedded object in 'item2'; license not found

An embedded object could not be created during the load of a form, User Control, User Document, or Property Page from a text file, due to the license file not being found. You must have a license to use this object. Check with the object's vendor for more information. This message is written to the error log file.
