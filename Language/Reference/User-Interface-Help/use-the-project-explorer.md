# Use the Project Explorer

The **[Project Explorer](project-explorer.md)** displays a hierarchical list of the [projects](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) and all of the items contained and referenced by each project.

**To navigate the Project Explorer**

1. From the **View** menu, choose **Project Explorer** (CTRL+R), or use the toolbar shortcut: ![Toolbar button](../../../images/tbr_pexp_ZA01201722.gif).
    
2. Select an item from the collapsible tree that includes all projects and their components.
    
3. Choose the **View Code** button to open the Code window to begin entering code, or choose the **View Object** button to open a window containing the specified object. You can also choose the **Toggle Folders** button to toggle between folder view and folder contents view.
