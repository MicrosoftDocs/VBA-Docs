# ZOrder Method

Places the object at the front or back of the [z-order](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#z-order).

## Syntax

_object_. **ZOrder(** [ _zPosition_ ] **)**
The  **ZOrder** method syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _zPosition_|Optional. A control's position, front or back, in the container's z-order.|

 **Settings**
The settings for  _zPosition_ are:


|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _fmTop_|0|Places the control at the front of the z-order. The control appears on top of other controls (default).|
| _fmBottom_|1|Places the control at the back of the z-order. The control appears underneath other controls.|

## Remarks

The z-order determines how windows and controls are stacked when they are presented to the user. Items at the back of the z-order are overlaid by closer items; items at the front of the z-order appear to be on top of items at the back. When the  _zPosition_ argument is omitted, the object is brought to the front.
In [design mode](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#design-mode), the Bring to Front or Send To Back commands set the z-order. Bring to Front is equivalent to using the  **ZOrder** method and putting the object at the front of the z-order. Send to Back is equivalent to using **ZOrder** and putting the object at the back of the z-order.
This method does not affect content or sequence of the controls in the  **Controls** collection.

 **Note**  You can't Undo or Redo layering commands, such as  **Send to Back** or **Bring to Front**. For example, if you select an object and click **Move Backward** on the shortcut menu, you won't be able to Undo or Redo that action.
