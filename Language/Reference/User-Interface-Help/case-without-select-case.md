# Case without Select Case

A  **Case** statement must occur within a **Select Case...End Select Block**. This error has the following cause and solution:



- A  **Case** statement can't be matched with a preceding **Select Case** statement. Check other control structures within the **Select Case...Case** structure and verify that they are correctly matched. For example, an **If** without a matching **End If** inside the **Select Case...End Select** structure generates this error.
