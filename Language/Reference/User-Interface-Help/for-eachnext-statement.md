# For Each...Next statement

Repeats a group of [statements](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#statement) for each element in an [array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array) or [collection](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#collection).

## Syntax

**For Each** _element_ **In** _group_ <br/>
 [ _statements_ ] <br/>
 [ **Exit For** ] <br/>
 [ _statements_ ] <br/>
**Next** [ _element_ ]

<br/>

The **For...Each...Next** statement syntax has these parts:

|Part|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
| _element_|Required. [Variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) used to iterate through the elements of the collection or array. For collections, _element_ can only be a **[Variant](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variant-data-type)** variable, a generic object variable, or any specific object variable. For arrays, _element_ can only be a **Variant** variable.|
| _group_|Required. Name of an object collection or array (except an array of [user-defined types](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#user-defined-type)).|
| _statements_|Optional. One or more statements that are executed on each item in _group_.|

## Remarks

The **For…Each** block is entered if there is at least one element in _group_. After the loop has been entered, all the statements in the loop are executed for the first element in _group_. If there are more elements in _group_, the statements in the loop continue to execute for each element. When there are no more elements in _group_, the loop is exited and execution continues with the statement following the **Next** statement.

Any number of **[Exit For](exit-statement.md)** statements may be placed anywhere in the loop as an alternative way to exit. **Exit For** is often used after evaluating some condition, for example **If…Then**, and transfers control to the statement immediately following **Next**.

You can nest **For...Each...Next** loops by placing one **For…Each…Next** loop within another. However, each loop _element_ must be unique.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you omit _element_ in a **Next** statement, execution continues as if _element_ is included. If a **Next** statement is encountered before its corresponding **For** statement, an error occurs.

You can't use the **For...Each...Next** statement with an array of user-defined types because a **Variant** can't contain a user-defined type.

## Example

This example uses the **For Each...Next** statement to search the **Text** property of all elements in a collection for the existence of the string "Hello". In the example, `MyObject` is a text-related object and is an element of the collection `MyCollection`. Both are generic names used for illustration purposes only.


```vb
Dim Found, MyObject, MyCollection 
Found = False    ' Initialize variable. 
For Each MyObject In MyCollection    ' Iterate through each element.  
    If MyObject.Text = "Hello" Then    ' If Text equals "Hello". 
        Found = True    ' Set Found to True. 
        Exit For    ' Exit loop. 
    End If 
Next
```
