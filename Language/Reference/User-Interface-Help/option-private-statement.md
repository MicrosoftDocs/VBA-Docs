# Option Private Statement

When used in host applications that allow references across multiple [projects](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project),  **Option Private Module** prevents a[module's](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module') contents from being referenced outside its project. In host applications that don't permit such references, for example, standalone versions of Visual Basic, **Option Private** has no effect.

## Syntax

**Option Private Module**

## Remarks

If used, the  **Option** **Private** statement must appear at[module level](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module-level), before any [procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure).
When a module contains  **Option Private Module**, the public parts, for example,[variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable), [objects](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object), and [user-defined types](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#user-defined-type) declared at module level, are still available within the[project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) containing the module, but they are not available to other applications or projects.

 **Note**   **Option Private** is only useful for[host applications](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#host-application) that support simultaneous loading of multiple projects and permit references between the loaded projects. For example, Microsoft Excel permits loading of multiple projects and **Option Private Module** can be used to restrict cross-project visibility. Although Visual Basic permits loading of multiple projects, references between projects are never permitted in Visual Basic.


## Example

This example demonstrates the  **Option Private** statement, which is used at module level to indicate that the entire module is private. With **Option Private Module**, module-level parts not declared **Private** are available to other modules in the project, but not to other projects or applications.


```vb
Option Private Module ' Indicates that module is private. 

```
