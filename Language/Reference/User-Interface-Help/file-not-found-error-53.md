# File not found (Error 53)

The file was not found where specified. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- A statement, for example,  **Kill**, **Name**, or **Open**, refers to a file that doesn't exist. Check the spelling of the file name and the path specification.
    
- An attempt has been made to call a procedure in a [dynamic-link library (DLL)](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#dynamic-link-library-dll), but the library or resource file name specified in the  **Lib** clause of the **Declare** statement can't be found.
    
    Check the spelling of the file name and the path specification.
    
- In the development environment, this error occurs if you attempt to open a [project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) or load a text file that doesn't exist.
    
    Check the spelling of the project name or file name and the path specification.
