# GetAllSettings Function



Returns a list of key settings and their respective values (originally created with  **SaveSetting**) from an application's entry in the Windows[registry](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#registry) or (on the Macintosh) information in the application's initialization file.

## Syntax

**GetAllSettings( _appname,_** **_section_ )**
The  **GetAllSettings** function syntax has these[named arguments](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#named-argument):


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**_appname_**|Required. [String expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#String-expression) containing the name of the application or[project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) whose key settings are requested. On the Macintosh, this is the filename of the initialization file in the Preferences folder in the System folder.|
|**_section_**|Required. String e **xpression** containing the name of the section whose key settings are requested. **GetAllSettings** returns a[Variant](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#Variant) whose contents is a two-dimensional[array](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#array) of strings containing all the key settings in the specified section and their corresponding values.|

**GetAllSettings** returns an uninitialized **Variant** if either **_appname_** or **_section_** does not exist.

## Example

This example first uses the  **SaveSetting** statement to make entries in the Windows registry for the application specified as **_appname_**, then uses the **GetAllSettings** function to display the settings. Note that application names and **_section_** names can't be retrieved with **GetAllSettings**. Finally, the **DeleteSetting** statement removes the application's entries.


```vb
' Variant to hold 2-dimensional array returned by GetAllSettings
' Integer to hold counter.
Dim MySettings As Variant, intSettings As Integer
' Place some settings in the registry.
SaveSetting appname := "MyApp", section := "Startup", _
key := "Top", setting := 75
SaveSetting "MyApp","Startup", "Left", 50
' Retrieve the settings.
MySettings = GetAllSettings(appname := "MyApp", section := "Startup")
    For intSettings = LBound(MySettings, 1) To UBound(MySettings, 1)
        Debug.Print MySettings(intSettings, 0), MySettings(intSettings, 1)
    Next intSettings
DeleteSetting "MyApp", "Startup"


```
