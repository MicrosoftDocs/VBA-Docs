# Block If without End If

An error occurred due to an incomplete statement. This error has the following cause and solution:



- An  **If** statement is used without a corresponding **End If** statement. A multiline **If** statement must terminate with a matching **End If** statement. For nested **If...End If** statements, make sure there is a correctly matched **If...End If** structure inside each enclosing **If...End If** structure.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
