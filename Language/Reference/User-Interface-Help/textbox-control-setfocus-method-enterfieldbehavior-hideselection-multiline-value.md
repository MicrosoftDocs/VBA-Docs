# TextBox control, SetFocus method, EnterFieldBehavior, HideSelection, MultiLine, Value properties example

The following example demonstrates the **[HideSelection](hideselection-property.md)** property in the context of either a single form or more than one form. 

The user can select text in a **[TextBox](textbox-control.md)** and tab to other controls on a form, as well as transfer the focus to a second form. This code sample also uses the **[SetFocus](setfocus-method.md)** method, and the **[EnterFieldBehavior](enterfieldbehavior-property.md)**, **[MultiLine](multiline-property.md)**, and **[Value](value-property-microsoft-forms.md)** properties.

To use this example, follow these steps:

1. Copy this sample code (except for the last event subroutine) to the Declarations portion of a form.
    
2. Add a large **TextBox** named TextBox1, a **[ToggleButton](togglebutton-control.md)** named ToggleButton1, and a **[CommandButton](commandbutton-control.md)** named CommandButton1.
    
3. Insert a second form into this project named UserForm2.
    
4. Paste the last event subroutine of this listing into the Declarations section of UserForm2.
    
5. In this form, add a **CommandButton** named CommandButton1.
    
6. Run UserForm1.
    


```vb
' ***** Code for UserForm1 ***** 
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 TextBox1.SetFocus 
 UserForm2.Show 'Bring up the second form. 
End Sub
```

<br/>


```vb
Private Sub ToggleButton1_Click() 
 If ToggleButton1.Value = True Then 
 TextBox1.HideSelection = False 
 ToggleButton1.Caption = "Selection Visible" 
 Else 
 TextBox1.HideSelection = True 
 ToggleButton1.Caption = "Selection Hidden" 
 End If 
End Sub
```

<br/>


```vb
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() 
 TextBox1.MultiLine = True 
 TextBox1.EnterFieldBehavior = fmEnterFieldBehaviorRecallSelection 
 
'Fill the TextBox 
 TextBox1.Text = "SelText indicates the starting " _ 
 & "point of selected text, or the insertion " _ 
 & point if no text is selected." & Chr$(10) _ 
 & Chr$(13) & "The SelStart property is " _ 
 & "always valid, even when the control does " _ 
 & "not have focus. Setting SelStart to a " _ 
 & "value less than zero creates an error. " _ 
 & Chr$(10) & Chr$(13) & "Changing the value " _ 
 & "of SelStart cancels any existing " _ 
 & "selection in the control, places " _ 
 & "an insertion point in the text, and sets " _ 
 & "the SelLength property to zero." 
 
 TextBox1.HideSelection = True 
 ToggleButton1.Caption = "Selection Hidden" 
 ToggleButton1.Value = False 

End Sub
```

<br/>


```vb
'
' ***** Code for UserForm2 *****

Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 UserForm2.Hide 
End Sub
```
