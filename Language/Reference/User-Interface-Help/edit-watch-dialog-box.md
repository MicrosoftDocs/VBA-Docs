# Edit Watch Dialog Box


![Edit watch dialog box](../../../images/editwtch_ZA01201603.gif)



Use to delete or edit the context or type of a [watch expression](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#watch-expression).




 **Important**  When selecting a context for a watch expression, use the narrowest [scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope) that fits your needs. Selecting all procedures or all modules could slow down execution considerably, since the expression is evaluated after execution of each statement. Selecting a specific procedure for a context affects execution only while the procedure is in the list of active procedure calls.



## Dialog Box Options

 **Expression**

Displays the selected expression by default. The expression is a variable, a property, a function call, or any other valid expression. You may enter a different expression to evaluate.

 **Context**

Sets the scope of the variables watched in the expression.




- Procedure — Displays the procedure name where the selected term resides (default). Defines the procedure(s) in which the expression is evaluated. You may select all procedures or a specific procedure context in which to evaluate the variable.
    
- Module — Displays the [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module) name where the selected term resides (default). You may select all modules or a specific module context in which to evaluate the variable.
    
- Project — Displays the name of the current project. Expressions can't be evaluated in a context outside of the current project.
    


 **Watch Type**

Determines how Visual Basic responds to the watch expression.




- Watch Expression — Displays the watch expression and its value in the  **Watch** window. When you enter break mode, the value of the watch expression is automatically updated.
    
- Break When Value Is True — Execution automatically enters break mode when the expression evaluates to true or is any nonzero value (not valid for string expressions).
    
- Break When Value Changes — Execution automatically enters break mode when the value of expression changes within the specified context.
    


 **Delete**

Deletes the watch expression.
