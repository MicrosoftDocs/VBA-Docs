# Click Event



Occurs in one of two cases:


- The user clicks a control with the mouse.
    
- The user definitively selects a value for a control with more than one possible value.

## Syntax

For MultiPage, TabStrip **Private Sub**_object_ _**Click(**_index_**As Long)**
For all other controls **Private Sub**_object_ _**Click( )**
The  **Click** event syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _index_|Required. The index of the page or tab in a  **MultiPage** or **TabStrip** associated with this event.|

## Remarks

Of the two cases where the Click event occurs, the first case applies to the  **CommandButton**, **Frame**, **Image**, **Label**, **ScrollBar**, and **SpinButton**. The second case applies to the **CheckBox**, **ComboBox**, **ListBox**, **MultiPage**, **TabStrip**, and **ToggleButton**. It also applies to an **OptionButton** when the value changes to **True**.
The following are examples of actions that initiate the Click event:


- Clicking a blank area of a form or a disabled control (other than a list box) on the form.
    
- Clicking a  **CommandButton**. If the command button doesn't already have the[focus](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#focus), the Enter event occurs before the Click event.
    
- Pressing the SPACEBAR when a  **CommandButton** has the focus.
    
- Clicking a control.
    
- Pressing ENTER on a form that has a command button whose  **Default** property is set to **True**, as long as no other command button has the focus.
    
- Pressing ESC on a form that has a command button whose  **Cancel** property is set to **True**, as long as no other command button has the focus.
    
- Pressing a control's [accelerator key](../../../language/Glossary/glossary-vba.md#accelerator-key).
    

When the Click event results from clicking a control, the sequence of events leading to the Click event is:


1. MouseDown
    
2. MouseUp
    
3. Click
    

For some controls, the Click event occurs when the  **Value** property changes. However, using the Change event is the preferred technique for detecting a new value for a property. The following are examples of actions that initiate the Click event due to assigning a new value to a control:


- Clicking a different page or tab in a  **MultiPage** or **TabStrip**. The **Value** property for these controls reflects the current **Page** or **Tab**. Clicking the current page or tab does not change the control's value and does not initiate the Click event.
    
- Clicking a  **CheckBox** or **ToggleButton**, pressing the SPACEBAR when one of these controls has the focus, pressing the accelerator key for one of these controls, or changing the value of the control in code.
    
- Changing the value of an  **OptionButton** to **True**. Setting one **OptionButton** in a group to **True** sets all other buttons in the group to **False**, but the Click event occurs only for the button whose value changes to **True**.
    
- Selecting a value for a  **ComboBox** or **ListBox** so that it unquestionably matches an item in the control's drop-down list. For example, if a list is not sorted, the first match for characters typed in the edit region may not be the only match in the list, so choosing such a value does not initiate the Click event. In a sorted list, you can use entry-matching to ensure that a selected value is a unique match for text the user types.
    

The Click event is not initiated when  **Value** is set to **Null**.

 **Note**  Clicking changes the value of a control, thus it initiates the Click event. When you right-click, the value of the control does not change, so it does not initiate the Click event.
