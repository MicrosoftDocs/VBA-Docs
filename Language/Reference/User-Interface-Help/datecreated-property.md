# DateCreated property

Returns the date and time that the specified file or folder was created. Read-only.

_object_.**DateCreated**

The _object_ is always a **[File](file-object.md)** or **[Folder](folder-object.md)** object.

## Remarks

```vb
Sub ShowFileInfo(filespec)
    Dim fs, f, s
    Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    Set f = fs.GetFile(filespec)
    s = "Created: " & f.DateCreated
    MsgBox s
End Sub
```
