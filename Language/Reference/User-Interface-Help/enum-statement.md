# Enum Statement

Declares a type for an enumeration.

## Syntax

[ **Public** |**Private** ] **Enum**_name_

 _membername_ [= _constantexpression_ ]
 _membername_ [= _constantexpression_ ]
 **. . .**
 **End Enum**
The  **Enum** statement has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Public**|Optional. Specifies that the  **Enum** type is visible throughout the[project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project).  **Enum** types are **Public** by default.|
|**Private**|Optional. Specifies that the  **Enum** type is visible only within the[module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module) in which it appears.|
| _name_|Required. The name of the  **Enum** type. The _name_ must be a valid Visual Basic identifier and is specified as the type when declaring[variables](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) or[parameters](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#parameter) of the **Enum** type.|
| _membername_|Required. A valid Visual Basic identifier specifying the name by which a constituent element of the  **Enum** type will be known.|
| _constantexpression_|Optional. Value of the element (evaluates to a  **Long**). If no _constantexpression_ is specified, the value assigned is either zero (if it is the first _membername_ ), or 1 greater than the value of the immediately preceding _membername_.|

## Remarks

Enumeration variables are variables declared with an  **Enum** type. Both variables and parameters can be declared with an **Enum** type. The elements of the **Enum** type are initialized to constant values within the **Enum** statement. The assigned values can't be modified at[run time](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#run-time) and can include both positive and negative numbers. For example:



```vb
Enum SecurityLevel 
 IllegalEntry = -1 
 SecurityLevel1 = 0 
 SecurityLevel2 = 1 
End Enum 

```

An  **Enum** statement can appear only at[module level](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module-level). Once the  **Enum** type is defined, it can be used to declare variables, parameters, or[procedures](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) returning its type. You can't qualify an **Enum** type name with a module name. **Public** **Enum** types in a[class module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#class-module) are not members of the class; however, they are written to the[type library](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-library).  **Enum** types defined in[standard modules](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#standard-module) aren't written to type libraries. **Public Enum** types of the same name can't be defined in both standard modules and class modules, since they share the same name space. When two **Enum** types in different type libraries have the same name, but different elements, a reference to a variable of the type depends on which type library has higher priority in the **References**.
You can't use an  **Enum** type as the target in a **With** block.

## Example

The following example shows the  **Enum** statement used to define a collection of named constants. In this case, the constants are colors you might choose to design data entry forms for a database.


```vb
Public Enum InterfaceColors 
 icMistyRose = &HE1E4FF& 
 icSlateGray = &H908070& 
 icDodgerBlue = &HFF901E& 
 icDeepSkyBlue = &HFFBF00& 
 icSpringGreen = &H7FFF00& 
 icForestGreen = &H228B22& 
 icGoldenrod = &H20A5DA& 
 icFirebrick = &H2222B2& 
End Enum
```
