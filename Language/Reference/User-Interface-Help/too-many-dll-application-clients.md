# Too many DLL application clients

The [dynamic-link library (DLL)](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#dynamic-link-library-(DLL)) for Visual Basic can only accommodate access by 50[host applications](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#host-application) at a time. This error has the following cause and solution:



- Your application and other applications that are Visual Basic hosts (some of which may be accessed by your application) are all attempting to access the Visual Basic DLL at the same time. Reduce the number of open applications accessing Visual Basic.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
