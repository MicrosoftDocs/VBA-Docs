# This command will stop the debugger.

Some commands and actions cause Visual Basic to stop analyzing code. This error has the following cause and solution:



- Some edits, like declaring a  **Static**[variable](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable), and some commands, like those for adding a new [module](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module) or form, cause running or suspended code to stop.
    
    If you don't want to stop running code, don't add or execute the command.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
