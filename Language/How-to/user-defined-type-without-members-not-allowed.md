# User-defined type without members not allowed

[User-defined types](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#user-defined-type) must have at least one element. This error has the following cause and solution:

- You specified an empty user-defined type in a **Type...End Type** definition. Check the **Type** statement for unintended [comment](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#comment) delimiters.
    
For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
