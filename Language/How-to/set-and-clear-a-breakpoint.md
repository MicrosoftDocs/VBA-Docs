# Set and Clear a Breakpoint

You set a [breakpoint](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#breakpoint) to suspend execution at a specific statement in a[procedure](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure); for example, where you suspect problems may exist. You clear breakpoints when you no longer need them to stop execution.

 **To set a breakpoint**




1. Position the insertion point anywhere in a line of the [procedure](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure) where you want execution to halt.
    
2. On the  **Debug** menu, click **Toggle Breakpoint** (F9), click next to the statement in the **Margin Indicator Bar** (if visible), or use the toolbar shortcut:
![Toolbar button](../../images/tbr_bkpt_ZA01201681.gif). The breakpoint is added and the line is set to the breakpoint color defined on the  **Editor Format** tab in the **Options** dialog box.
    

If you set a breakpoint on a line that contains several statements separated by colons (**:**), the break always occurs at the first statement on the line.
 **To clear a breakpoint**


1. Position the insertion point anywhere on a line of the procedure containing the breakpoint.
    
2. From the  **Debug** menu, choose **Toggle Breakpoint** (F9), or click next to the statement in the **Margin Indicator Bar** (if visible).
    
3. The breakpoint is cleared and highlighting is removed.
    

 **To clear all breakpoints in the application**


- From the  **Debug** menu, choose **Clear All Breakpoints** (CTRL+SHIFT+F9).
    
     **Note**  Breakpoints set in code are not saved when you save your code.
