# Start code execution

One way to test your code is to run it and work with it as a user would.

**To start code execution**

- Choose **Run Sub/UserForm** (F5) from the **[Run](../reference/user-interface-help/run-menu.md)** menu.
    

If your application doesn't run, it may be because:

- A [syntax error](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#syntax-error) or some other error exists in your code.
    
- A [logic error](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#logic-error) exists in your code, which may result in a [run-time error](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#run-time-error).
    
To get Help, choose the **Help** button or press F1 while the error message is displayed. Consider the suggestions provided to correct the error before you run your code again.
