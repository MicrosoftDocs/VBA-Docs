# Trace Code Execution

You trace code execution because it may not always be obvious which statement is executed first. Use these techniques to trace the execution of code:



-  **Step Into**: Traces through each line of code and steps into[procedures](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#procedure). This allows you to view the effect of each statement on [variables](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable).
    
-  **Step Over**: Executes each procedure as if it were a single statement. Use this instead of **Step Into** to step across procedure calls rather than into the called procedure.
    
-  **Step Out**: Executes all remaining code in a procedure as if it were a single statement, and exits to the next statement in the procedure that caused the procedure to be called initially.
    
-  **Run To Cursor**: Allows you to select a statement in your code where you want execution to stop. This allows you to "step over" sections of code, for example, large loops.
    

 **To trace execution from the current statement**


- From the  **Debug** menu, choose **Step Into** (F8), **Step Over** (SHIFT+F8), **Step Out** (CTRL+SHIFT+F8), or **Run To Cursor** (CTRL+F8).
    

 **To trace execution from the beginning of the program**


- From the  **Debug** menu, choose **Step Into** (F8), **Step Over** (SHIFT+F8), **Step Out** (CTRL+SHIFT+F8), or **Run To Cursor** (CTRL+F8).
