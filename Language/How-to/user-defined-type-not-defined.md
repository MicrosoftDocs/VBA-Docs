# User-defined type not defined

You can create your own [data types](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#data-type) in Visual Basic, but they must be defined first in a **Type...End Type** statement or in a properly registered[object library](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#object-library) or[type library](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#type-library). This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to declare a [variable](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#variable) or[argument](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#argument) with an undefined data type or you specified an unknown[class](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#class) or object.
    
    Use the  **Type** statement in a[module](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#module) to define a new data type. If you are trying to create a reference to a class, the class must be visible to the[project](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project). If you are referring to a class in your program, you must have a [class module](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#class-module) of the specified name in your project. Check the spelling of the type name or name of the object.
    
- The type you want to declare is in another module but has been declared  **Private**. Move the definition of the type to a[standard module](../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#standard-module) where it can be **Public**.
    
- The type is a valid type, but the object library or type library in which it is defined isn't registered in Visual Basic. Display the  **References** dialog box, and then select the appropriate object library or type library. For example, if you don't check the **Data Access Object** in the **References** dialog box, types like Database, Recordset, and TableDef aren't recognized and references to them in code cause this error.
