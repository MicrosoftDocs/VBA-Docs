# What's new for VBA in Office 2019

<!--From Elizabeth 12/18/18 - There are actually a whole bunch of items that need to get added but some of the hosts teams don’t have the resources to add the docs. I decided to start with what I had: confirmed items that are doc’d, confirmed items that should be doc’d. I’m not in a hurry to add it to the TOC, and I have a task that we should update the various hosts articles that reference the “What’s in Office 2016” article to instead reference the 2019 one. That’ll probably be next month though as I’m going on vacation later this week. Instructions: push live, but do not add to TOC yet.-->

The following tables summarize the new Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) language updates for Office 2019.
