# Using the Document Inspector

The **Document Inspector** gives users an easy way to examine documents for personal or sensitive information, text phrases, and other document contents. They can use the **Document Inspector** to remove unwanted information; for example, before distributing a document.

> [!NOTE] 
> Microsoft does not support the automatic removal of hidden information for signed or protected documents, or for documents that use Information Rights Management (IRM). We recommend that you run the **Document Inspector** before you sign a document or invoke IRM on a document.

As a developer, you can use the Document Inspector framework to extend the built-in modules and integrate your extensions into the standard user interface. 

The **Document Inspector** in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint includes the following enhancements.

## Opening the Document Inspector

To open the **Document Inspector**:

1. Choose the **File** tab, and then choose **Info**.
    
2. Choose **Check for Issues**.
    
3. Choose **Inspect Document**.
    
Use the **Document Inspector** dialog box to select the type or types of data to find in the document.

After the modules complete the inspection, the **Document Inspector** displays the results for each module in a dialog box. If a given module finds data, the dialog box includes a **Remove All** button that you can click to remove that data. If the module does not find data, the dialog box displays a message to that effect.

If you choose to remove the data for a given module, the dialog box displays descriptive text that indicates whether the operation was successful or not. If the **Document Inspector** encounters errors during the operation, the module is flagged, displays an error message, and the data for that module does not change.
