# SolverLoad Function

Loads existing Solver model parameters that have been saved to the worksheet.


 **Note**  The Solver add-in is not enabled by default. Before you can use this function, you must have the Solver add-in enabled and installed. For information about how to do that, see  [Using the Solver VBA Functions](using-the-solver-vba-functions.md). After the Solver add-in is installed, you must establish a reference to the Solver add-in. In the Visual Basic Editor, with a module active, click **References** on the **Tools** menu, and then select **Solver** under **Available References**. If **Solver** does not appear under **Available References**, click **Browse**, and then open Solver.xlam in the \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\Library\SOLVER subfolder.


 **SolverLoad( _LoadArea_**, **_Merge_)**

 **LoadArea** Required **Variant**. A reference on the active worksheet to a range of cells from which you want to load a complete problem specification. The first cell in the **_LoadArea_** contains a formula for the **Set Target Cell** box in the **Solver Parameters** dialog box; the second cell contains a formula for the **By Changing Cells** box; subsequent cells contain constraints in the form of logical formulas. The last cell optionally contains an array of Solver option values. For more information, see **[SolverOptions](solveroptions-function.md)**. The range represented by the argument **_LoadArea_** can be on any worksheet, but you must specify the worksheet if it is not the active sheet. For example, `SolverLoad("Sheet2!A1:A3")` loads a model from Sheet2 even if it is not the active sheet.
 **Merge** Optional **Variant**. A logical value corresponding to either the **Merge** button or the **Replace** button in the dialog box that appears after you select the **LoadArea** reference and click **OK**. If **True**, the variable cell selections and constraints from the LoadArea are merged with the currently defined variables and constraints. If **False** or omitted, the current model specifications and options are erased (equivalent to a call to the **[SolverReset](solverreset-function.md)** function) before the new specifications are loaded.

## Example

This example loads the previously calculated Solver model stored on Sheet1, changes one of the constraints, and then solves the model again.


```vb
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
SolverLoad loadArea:=Range("A33:A38") 
SolverChange cellRef:=Range("F4:F6"), _ 
 relation:=1, _ 
 formulaText:=200 
SolverSolve userFinish:=False
```
