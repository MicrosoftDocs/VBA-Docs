# Using the Solver VBA Functions

Before you can use the Solver VBA functions from VBA, you must enable the Solver add-in in the **Excel Options** dialog box.


1. Click the **File** tab, and then click **Options** below the **Excel** tab.
    
2. In the **Excel Options** dialog box, click **Add-Ins**.
    
3. In the **Manage** drop-down box, select **Excel Add-ins**, and then click **Go**.
    
4. In the **Add-Ins** dialog box, select **Solver Add-in**, and then click OK.
    

After you have enabled the Solver add-in, Excel will auto-install the Add-in if it is not already installed, and the **Solver** command will be added to the **Analysis** group on the **Data** tab in the ribbon.

Before you can use the Solver VBA functions in the Visual Basic Editor, you must establish a reference to the Solver add-in. In the Visual Basic Editor, with a module active, click **References** on the **Tools** menu, and then select **Solver** under **Available References**. If **Solver** does not appear under **Available References**, click **Browse**, and then open Solver.xlam in the \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\Library\SOLVER subfolder.
The following functions can be used to control the Solver add-in from VBA. Each function corresponds to an action that you can perform interactively, through the **Solver Parameters**, **Solver Options**, and **Solver Results** dialog boxes of the Solver add-in.
