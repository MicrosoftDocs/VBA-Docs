# About the PowerPivot Model Object in Excel
Learn about the PowerPivot add-in model and its object model in Excel.

## About the PowerPivot Model Object
<a name="XLPowerPivotModel_About"> </a>

The PowerPivot add-in enables you to visually build your own cubes. A data cube is an array of data defined in dimensions or layers. The **Model** object in Excel implemented by the PowerPivot add-in provides the foundation to load and combine source data from several data sources for data analysis on the desktop, including relational databases, multidimensional sources, cloud services, data feeds, Excel files, text files, and data from the Web. Excel integrates additional data sources and enables the ability to combine data from multiple data sources.

The creation and deletion of the PowerPivot Model (PPM) is triggered by user exposed actions and cannot be created directly by the developer.


## Relationships defined
<a name="XLPowerPivotModel_Relationships"> </a>

Throughout this article, we will refer to the connection between two tables that establishes how the data should be correlated as relationships.

Relationships join together data from previously unrelated data sources. Each relationship has a  _Primary Key_ and a _Foreign Key_. Relationships allow the data to be joined together into a single model. This allows for:


- Filtering data in one table by data in a related table

- Filtering data by related columns
    
- Integrating columns from multiple tables into a PivotTable/PivotChart
    
- Keeping workbooks smaller by not having to repeat data
    

## Single Models Only
<a name="XLPowerPivotModel_Single"> </a>

Excel with the PowerPivot add-in creates a single model in the workbook to which it can add data sources, create, modify, and relate tables. There can only be a single model in a workbook.


## Working with OLAP data sources
<a name="XLPowerPivotModel_OLAP"> </a>

When connecting to an OLAP data source such as Analysis Services and creating OLAP PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers or Cube functions, no model is created. Workbooks created with the PowerPivot add-in can be uploaded to SharePoint, loaded in memory on the server, and accessed by other workbooks as if it were a normal instance of SQL Server Analysis Services.


## Triggering the creation of a PowerPivot Model
<a name="XLPowerPivotModel_Triggering"> </a>

By default, XLSX files in Excel 2010 and Excel do not have a PPM initialized in them until the model is deemed necessary. Certain actions trigger the creation of a PPM if there is no existing model in the workbook. The following sections describe the actions that will trigger the creation of a PPM when it does not exist in the workbook.


### Adding a new non-legacy data source

Any time you import certain types of data, a new model is created in the workbook (if one does not already exist) that contains the connection properties, table representation of the workbook data sources, and the relationships between them. This includes internal data sources like ranges and tables. Table 1 lists the different data sources that can be integrated with the PPM.

 **Table 1. Data sources compatible with the PowerPivot Model**

|**Data Source**|**Description**|**Table Preview**|**Query Supported**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Microsoft SQL Server|Already supported in Excel|Yes|Yes|
|Microsoft SQL Azure Data Market|Supported as a new data feed data source|Yes|No|
|Microsoft SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse|Supported via installed OLE DB driver|Yes|Yes|
|Microsoft Access|Already supported in Excel|Yes|Yes|
|Oracle|Already supported in Excel|Yes|Yes|
|Teradata|Available if OLE DB or ODBC driver is installed|No|No|
|Sybase|Available if OLE DB or ODBC driver is installed|No|No|
|Informix|Available if OLE DB or ODBC driver is installed|No|No|
|IBM Db2|Available if OLE DB or ODBC driver is installed|No|No|
|Microsoft Analysis Services|Already supported in Excel|Yes|Yes|
|Report (SSRS)|Can read and use connections, but no authoring in Excel client|Yes|No|
|Text|From Excel dialog in Ribbon UI|Yes|No|
|Data Feeds (OData)|Supported as a new data source|Yes|Yes|
|XML|Already supported in Excel|No|No|
|SharePoint Lists|Already supported in Excel. Excel uses the **DataFeed** provider to connect to SharePoint|No|No|
|SharePoint|New feature in Excel|Yes|Yes|
|Excel Tables|User defined table in Excel used for new data feature. A Worksheet data connection is created to the table when the table is created.|N/A|N/A|
|Excel Ranges|User defined range in Excel used for new data feature. A Worksheet data connection in this case is created to the range only if a data feature like a chart or PivotTable uses the range.|N/A|N/A|

### Creating a new Excel non-OLAP PivotTable

New Excel PivotTables, other than the ones created from an OLAP data source, will be based on a PPM therefore if a PPM is not present in the file a new one is created as part of the PivotTable creation action. This includes the following:


- Using the insert PivotTable user interface
    
- Summarizing data with PivotTable user interface
    
- PivotTable based off of a non-OLAP data source created through the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) object model
    

### Creating a new Excel non-OLAP PivotChart

In Excel, PivotTables and PivotCharts have the ability to be no longer coupled. Therefore on insertion of a PivotChart in a workbook without a model, a PPM will be created.


### Pasting Excel non-OLAP PivotTables from another workbook

When pasting a PivotTable or PivotChart from another workbook that is based off of a PPM into one that does not have a PPM, a new PPM will be created in the destination workbook. A new data source will be added to the newly created model pointing to the underlying data of the originating PivotTable/PivotChart.


## Undoing the creation of a PowerPivot Model
<a name="XLPowerPivotModel_Undoing"> </a>

All actions that lead to the creation of a PPM can be undone. If these actions are selected from the undo menu, the actual model creation will not be undone but nothing will be added to it; therefore it will remain empty. When the workbook is saved, if the model is empty, the model will not be saved with the file. There is no explicit way for you to manually delete a model created in the workbook.


 **Note**  Similar to the behavior in Excel 2010, there is a restriction in what model sizes can be undone. When a model grows to this limit size undo functionality for actions such as refresh will no longer be provided. The current limit for native PivotTables is 300,000 rows, at 28 bytes a cell this limit is roughly 8MB in memory. These values can be set by using **Advanced Options** in Excel as shown in Figure 1.

## The PowerPivot Model Object Model
<a name="XLPowerPivotModel_PPMOM"> </a>

A workbook will be able to have one and only one **Model** object. The **Model** object represents the top level object that contains all its connections, relationships, and tables.

You are not able to manually create a model in a workbook; creation of the model is triggered through the actions described in a previous section in this article. If any of these actions are performed through the Object Model (OM), a new model is created. The purpose of this OM is for the programmatic creation of relationships between model tables resulting in joined tables, combining PivotTables, and so forth. For you to be able to this, you must be able to explore the model to find the appropriate tables and within the tables find the appropriate columns that would be used to create the relationship.


### Model Object

The **Model** object stores references to workbook connections and information about the tables and relationships contained within the PPM. Table 2 lists the properties of the **Model** object.

 **Table 2. Properties of the Model object**



|**Property**|**Read/Write**|**Type**|**Description**|

 **Model.AddConnection** Method

Adds a new workbook connection to the model with the same properties as the one supplied as an argument. This method only works on non-model external connections and will return an error if called with an external model connection as its argument. When calling this method, a new model connection is created and it is named the same as the legacy connection with an integer at the end to make the name unique. Table 3 lists the parameters of the **AddConnection** method.
