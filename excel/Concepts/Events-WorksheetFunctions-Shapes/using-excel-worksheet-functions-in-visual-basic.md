# Using Excel worksheet functions in Visual Basic

You can use most Microsoft Excel worksheet functions in your Visual Basic statements. For a list of the worksheet functions you can use, see [List of worksheet functions available to Visual Basic](list-of-worksheet-functions-available-to-visual-basic.md).

> [!NOTE] 
> Some worksheet functions are not useful in Visual Basic. For example, the **Concatenate** function is not needed because in Visual Basic you can use the **&** operator to join multiple text values.

## Calling a worksheet function from Visual Basic

In Visual Basic, the Excel worksheet functions are available through the **WorksheetFunction** object.

The following **Sub** procedure uses the **Min** worksheet function to determine the smallest value in a range of cells. First, the variable `myRange` is declared as a **Range** object, and then it is set to range A1:C10 on Sheet1. Another variable, `answer`, is assigned the result of applying the **Min** function to `myRange`. Finally, the value of  `answer` is displayed in a message box.

```vb
Sub UseFunction() 
 Dim myRange As Range 
 Set myRange = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:C10") 
 answer = Application.WorksheetFunction.Min(myRange) 
 MsgBox answer 
End Sub
```

<br/>

If you use a worksheet function that requires a range reference as an argument, you must specify a **Range** object. For example, you can use the **Match** worksheet function to search a range of cells. In a worksheet cell, you would enter a formula such as =MATCH(9,A1:A10,0). However, in a Visual Basic procedure, you would specify a **Range** object to get the same result.

```vb
Sub FindFirst() 
 myVar = Application.WorksheetFunction _ 
 .Match(9, Worksheets(1).Range("A1:A10"), 0) 
 MsgBox myVar 
End Sub
```

> [!NOTE] 
> Visual Basic functions do not use the **WorksheetFunction** qualifier. A function may have the same name as a Microsoft Excel function and yet work differently. For example, `Application.WorksheetFunction.Log` and `Log` will return different values.


## Inserting a worksheet function into a cell

To insert a worksheet function into a cell, you specify the function as the value of the **Formula** property of the corresponding **Range** object. In the following example, the RAND worksheet function (which generates a random number) is assigned to the **Formula** property of range A1:B3 on Sheet1 in the active workbook.

```vb
Sub InsertFormula() 
 Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:B3").Formula = "=RAND()" 
End Sub
```

## Example

This example uses the worksheet function **Pmt** to calculate a home mortgage loan payment. Notice that this example uses the **InputBox** method instead of the **InputBox** function so that the method can perform type checking. The **Static** statements cause Visual Basic to retain the values of the three variables; these are displayed as default values the next time you run the program.

```vb
Static loanAmt 
Static loanInt 
Static loanTerm 
loanAmt = Application.InputBox _ 
 (Prompt:="Loan amount (100,000 for example)", _ 
 Default:=loanAmt, Type:=1) 
loanInt = Application.InputBox _ 
 (Prompt:="Annual interest rate (8.75 for example)", _ 
 Default:=loanInt, Type:=1) 
loanTerm = Application.InputBox _ 
 (Prompt:="Term in years (30 for example)", _ 
 Default:=loanTerm, Type:=1) 
payment = Application.WorksheetFunction _ 
 .Pmt(loanInt / 1200, loanTerm * 12, loanAmt) 
MsgBox "Monthly payment is " & Format(payment, "Currency")
```
