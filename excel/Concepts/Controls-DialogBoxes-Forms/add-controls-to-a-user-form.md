# Add Controls to a User Form

To add  [controls](activex-controls.md) to a user form, find the control you want to add in the **Toolbox**, drag the control onto the form, and then drag an adjustment handle on the control until the control's outline is the size and shape you want.


 **Note**  Dragging a control, or a number of "grouped" controls from the form back to the **Toolbox** creates a template of the controls, which can be reused. This is a useful feature for implementing a standard interface for your applications.


After you have added controls to the form, use the commands on the **Format** menu in the Visual Basic Editor to adjust the control alignment and spacing.
