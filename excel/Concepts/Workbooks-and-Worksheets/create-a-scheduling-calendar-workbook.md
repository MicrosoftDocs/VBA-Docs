# Create a Scheduling Calendar Workbook

The following code example shows how to use information in one workbook to create a scheduling calendar workbook that contains one month per worksheet and can optionally include holidays and weekends.

 **Sample code provided by:** Holy Macro! Books, [Holy Macro! It's 2,500 Excel VBA Examples](https://www.mrexcel.com/store/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1)

To run this code, your workbook must have a worksheet named "Cover" that contains the following:


- A spin control that contains a list of years name "SpinButton1"
    
- An option button for the "with weekends" option named "OptionButton1"
    
- An option button for the "without weekends" option named "OptionButton2"
    
- An option button for the "with holidays" option named "OptionButton3"
    
- An option button for the "without holidays" option named "OptionButton4"
    
Your workbook must also contain a worksheet named "Employee" that lists the names of the employees you want on your calendar in column A starting in cell A3, and a worksheet named "Holidays" that lists the dates of the holidays in column A starting in cell A2 and the name of the holidays in column B starting in cell B2.
