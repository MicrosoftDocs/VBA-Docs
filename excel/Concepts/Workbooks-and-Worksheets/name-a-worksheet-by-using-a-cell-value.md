# Name a Worksheet By Using a Cell Value

This example shows how to name a worksheet by using the value in cell A1 on that sheet. This example verifies that the value in cell A1 is a valid worksheet name, and if it is a valid name, renames the active worksheet to equal the value of cell A1 by using the **[Name](../../../api/Excel.Worksheet.Name.md)** property of the **[Worksheet](../../../api/Excel.Worksheet.md)** object.

```vb
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)

        'If the target cell is empty (contents cleared) then do not change the sheet name
    If IsEmpty(Target) Then Exit Sub

    'If the length of the target cell's entry is greater than 31 characters, disallow the entry.
    If Len(Target.Value) > 31 Then
        MsgBox "Worksheet tab names cannot be greater than 31 characters in length." & vbCrLf & _
