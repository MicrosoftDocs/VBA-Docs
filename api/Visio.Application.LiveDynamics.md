# Application.LiveDynamics Property (Visio)

Controls whether Microsoft Visio recalculates shape properties during drag operations on every mouse move or only after the mouse button is released. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `LiveDynamics`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](./Visio.Application.md) object.


## Return value

Boolean


## Remarks

The  **LiveDynamics** property tracks actions, such as resizing and rotating shapes, and is effective when shapes are glued or related to each other. When the value of the **LiveDynamics** property is **True** , more events such as **CellChanged** occur. Solutions that respond to such events may operate more quickly if the **LiveDynamics** property is set to **False**.
