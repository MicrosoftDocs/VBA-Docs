# Viewer.OnSelectionChanged Event (Visio Viewer)

Occurs when the shape selection is changed in Microsoft Visio Viewer.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **OnSelectionChanged**(**_ShapeIndex_**)

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Viewer** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|ShapeIndex|Required| **Long**|The index of the newly selected shape.|

## Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

The collection of shapes in the Viewer is one-based, so the first shape in the collection has index 1.

You can change the selected shape in Visio Viewer programmatically by using the  **[SelectShape](Visio.SelectShape.md)** method.


## Example

The following code shows how to use the  **OnSelectionChanged** event to print the ID of the newly selected shape in Visio Viewer in the **Immediate** window.


```vb
Private Sub vsoViewer_OnSelectionChanged(ByVal ShapeIndex As Long)



    Debug.Print "Selected shape changed to shape " & vsoViewer.SelectedShapeIndex & "."

 

End Sub
```
