# HasErrorBars Property

 **True** if the series has error bars. This property isn't available for 3-D charts. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Example

This example removes error bars from series one. The example should be run on a 2-D line chart that has error bars for series one.


```vb
myChart.SeriesCollection(1).HasErrorBars = False
```
