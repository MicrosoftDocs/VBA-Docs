# Viewer.OnDocumentLoaded Event (Visio Viewer)

Occurs after a document is loaded into Microsoft Visio Viewer.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **OnDocumentLoaded**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Viewer** object.


### Return value

## Remarks

You can load a document into Visio Viewer programmatically by using the  **[Load](Visio.Load.md)** method.

To capture the  **OnDocumentLoaded** event when you are coding in Visual Basic 6.0, load the document in the **Form_Paint()** procedure. The event may not occur in response to calling the **Load** method within the **Form_Load()** procedure.


## Example

The following code shows how to display a message in the  **Immediate** window when a document is loaded in Visio Viewer, showing the name of the document.


```vb
Private Sub vsoViewer_OnDocumentLoaded()



        Debug.Print "Document loaded is "; vsoViewer.SRC

        

End Sub
```
