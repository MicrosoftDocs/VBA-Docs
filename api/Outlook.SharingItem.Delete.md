# SharingItem.Delete method (Outlook)

Removes a **[SharingItem](Outlook.SharingItem.md)** item from the folder that contains the item.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Delete**

_expression_ A variable that represents a [SharingItem](Outlook.SharingItem.md) object.


## Remarks

The **Delete** method deletes a single item in a collection. To delete all items in the **[Items](Outlook.Folder.Items.md)** collection of a folder, you must delete each item starting with the last item in the folder. For example, in the items collection of a folder, `AllItems`, if there are  `n` number of items in the folder, start deleting the item at `AllItems.Item(n)`, decrementing the index each time until you delete  `AllItems.Item(1)`.

The **Delete** method moves the item from the containing folder to the **Deleted Items** folder. If the containing folder is the **Deleted Items** folder, the **Delete** method removes the item permanently.
