# DropLines Property

Returns a  **[DropLines](Excel.DropLines-graph-object.md)** object that represents the drop lines for a series on a line chart or area chart. Applies only to line charts or area charts. Read-only.


## Example

This example turns on drop lines for chart group one and then sets their line style, weight, and color. The example should be run on a 2-D line chart that has one series.


```vb
With myChart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasDropLines = True 
 With .DropLines.Border 
 .LineStyle = xlThin 
 .Weight = xlMedium 
 .ColorIndex = 3 
 End With 
End With
