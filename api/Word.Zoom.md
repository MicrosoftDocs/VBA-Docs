# Zoom object (Word)

Contains magnification options (for example, the zoom percentage) for a window or pane. The **Zoom** object is a member of the **[Zooms](Word.zooms.md)** collection.


## Remarks

Use the **Zoom** property of the **View** object to return a single **Zoom** object. The following example sets the zoom percentage for the active window to 110 percent.


```vb
ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.Zoom.Percentage = 110
```

Use  **Zooms** (Index), where Index identifies the view type, to return a single **Zoom** object. The view type specified by index can be one of the following **[WdViewType](Word.WdViewType.md)** constants: **wdMasterView**, **wdNormalView**, **wdOutlineView**, **wdPrintPreview**, **wdPrintView**, or **wdWebView**. The following example sets the magnification for the active window so that an entire page is visible.




```vb
ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.ActivePane _ 
 .Zooms(wdPrintView).PageFit = wdPageFitFullPage
```

The **Add** method isn't available for the **Zooms** collection. The **Zooms** collection includes a single **Zoom** object for each of the various view types (such as outline, normal, or page layout).
