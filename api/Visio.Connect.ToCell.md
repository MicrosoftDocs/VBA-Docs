# Connect.ToCell Property (Visio)

Gets the cell to which a connection is made. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ToCell`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Connect](./Visio.Connect.md) object.


### Return value

Cell


## Remarks

A connection is defined by a reference in a cell in the shape from which the connection originates to a cell in the shape to which the connection is made. The  **ToCell** property returns the **Cell** object to which the connection is made.

Following is a list of possible connections and their related  **ToCell** property values.

 **From the begin or end cell of a 1-D shape to...**




-  **A connection point cell:** The **ToCell** property returns the Connection.X _i_ cell.
    
-  **A cell of a guide or guide point:** When the begin or end cell of a 1-D shape is glued to a cell of a guide or guide point, two connections are created—one from the endpoint's X cell to the guide's Angle cell, and the other from the endpoint's Y cell to the guide's Angle cell. The **ToCell** property of both **Connect** objects returns the Angle cell.
    
-  **The pin of a 2-D shape (creates dynamic glue):** The **ToCell** property returns the PinX cell.
    
-  **Any cell of a vertex row in a Geometry section:** A new connection point is created and the **ToCell** property returns the Connections.X _i_ cell.
    
-  **The begin or end cell of a 1-D shape:** A new connection point is created and the **ToCell** property returns the Connections.X _i_ cell.
    
-  **The edge (a cell in the Alignment section) of a 2-D shape:** A new connection point is created and the **ToCell** property returns the Connections.X _i_ cell.
    


 **From the edge (a cell in the Alignment section) of a 2-D shape to acell of a guide or guide point:** The **ToCell** property returns the Angle cell.

 **From an outward or inward/outward connection point cell of a 1-D shape to An inward or inward/outward connection point cell that is not a cell of a guide or guide point:** When these cells are glued, two connections are created—one from the BeginX cell of the 1-D shape to the Connections.X _i_ cell, and the other from the EndX cell of the 1-D shape to the Connections.Y _i_ cell. The **ToCell** property returns Connections.X _i_ for the first **Connect** object and Connections.Y _i_ for the other.

 **From an outward or inward/outward connection point cell of a 2-D shape that is not a guide or guide point to an inward or inward/outward type connection point cell that is not a cell of a guide or guide point:** If the outward connection point is directionless, the **ToCell** property returns the Connections.X _i_ cell. If the outward connection point has a direction, two connection points are created. The **ToCell** property returns the Connections.X _i_ cell for both **Connect** objects.

 **From a control handle to...**




-  **A connection point cell:** The **ToCell** property returns the Connections.Xi cell.
    
-  **A cell of a guide or guide point:** When a control point is glued to a cell of a guide or guide point, two connections are created—one from the control point's X cell to the guide's PinX and the other from the control point's Y cell to the guide's PinY cell. The **ToCell** property of the first **Connect** object returns the guide's PinX cell and, for the second **Connect** object, the guide's PinY cell.
    
-  **Any cell of a vertex row in a Geometry section:** A new connection point is created and the **ToCell** property returns the Connections.Xi cell.
    
-  **The begin or end cell of a 1-D shape:** A new connection point is created and the **ToCell** property returns the Connections.Xi cell.
    
-  **The edge (a cell in the Alignment section) of a 2-D shape:** A new connection point is created and the **ToCell** property returns the Connections.X _i_ cell.
    



## Example

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to extract connection information from a Microsoft Visio drawing. The example displays the connection information in the Immediate window.



This example assumes there is an active document that contains at least two connected shapes.
