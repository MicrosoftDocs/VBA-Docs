Returns or sets the point on the value axis where the category axis crosses it. Applies only to the value axis. Read/write  **Double**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**CrossesAt**

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Axis](Word.Axis.md)** object.


## Remarks

Setting this property causes the **[Crosses](Word.Axis.Crosses.md)** property to change to **xlAxisCrossesCustom**. **xlAxisCrossesCustom** is a constant in the **xlAxisCrosses** enumeration.

You cannot use this property on radar charts. For 3D charts, this property indicates where the plane defined by the category axes crosses the value axis.
