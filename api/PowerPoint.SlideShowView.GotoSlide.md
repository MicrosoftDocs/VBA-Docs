## Syntax

 _expression_. `GotoSlide`( `_Index_`, `_ResetSlide_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [SlideShowView](./PowerPoint.SlideShowView.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Index_|Required|**Integer**|The number of the slide to switch to.|
| _ResetSlide_|Optional|**MsoTriState**|Whether animation effects should be rerun when returning to the first slide. See Remarks for more information.|

## Remarks

|**msoTrue**|

If you switch from one slide to another during a slide show with ResetSlide set to  **msoFalse**, when you return to the first slide, its animation picks up where it left off. If you switch from one slide to another with ResetSlide set to **msoTrue**, when you return to the first slide, its entire animation starts over.


## Example

This example switches from the current slide to the slide three in slide show window one. If you switch back to the current slide during the slide show, its entire animation will start over.


```vb
With SlideShowWindows(1).View

    .GotoSlide 3

End With
```

This example switches from the current slide to the slide three in slide show window one. If you switch back to the current slide during the slide show, its animation will pick up where it left off.
