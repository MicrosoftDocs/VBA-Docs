# Shapes.AddPlaceholder method (PowerPoint)

Restores a previously deleted placeholder on a slide. Returns a **[Shape](PowerPoint.Shape.md)** object that represents the restored placeholder.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AddPlaceholder`( `_Type_`, `_Left_`, `_Top_`, `_Width_`, `_Height_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Shapes](PowerPoint.Shapes.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Type_|Required|**[PpPlaceholderType](PowerPoint.PpPlaceholderType.md)**|The type of placeholder. Placeholders of type  **ppPlaceholderVerticalBody** or **ppPlaceholderVerticalTitle** are found only on slides of layout type **ppLayoutVerticalText**, **ppLayoutClipArtAndVerticalText**, **ppLayoutVerticalTitleAndText**, or **ppLayoutVerticalTitleAndTextOverChart**. You cannot create slides with any of these layouts from the user interface; you must create them programmatically by using the **Add** method or by setting the **Layout** property of an existing slide.|
| _Left_|Optional|**Single**|The position (in points) of the upper-left corner of the placeholder relative to the upper-left corner of the document.|
| _Top_|Optional|**Single**|The position (in points) of the upper-left corner of the placeholder relative to the upper-left corner of the document.|
| _Width_|Optional|**Single**|The width of the placeholder, in points.|
| _Height_|Optional|**Single**|The height of the placeholder, in points.|

## Return value

Shape


## Remarks

If more than one placeholder of a specified type has been deleted from the slide, the  **AddPlaceholder** method will add them back to the slide, one by one, starting with the placeholder that has the lowest original index number.


## Example

Suppose that slide two in the active presentation originally had a title at the top of the slide that's been deleted, either manually or with the following line of code.


```vb
ActivePresentation.Slides(2).Shapes.Placeholders(1).Delete
```

This example restores the deleted placeholder to slide two.




```vb
Application.ActivePresentation.Slides(2) _
    .Shapes.AddPlaceholder ppPlaceholderTitle
```
