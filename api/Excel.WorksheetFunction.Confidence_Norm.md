# WorksheetFunction.Confidence_Norm method (Excel)

Returns a value that you can use to construct a confidence interval for a population mean.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Confidence_Norm`( `_Arg1_` , `_Arg2_` , `_Arg3_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[WorksheetFunction](Excel.WorksheetFunction.md)' object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Arg1_|Required| **Double**|The significance level used to compute the confidence level. The confidence level equals 100*(1 - alpha)%, or in other words, an alpha of 0.05 indicates a 95 percent confidence level.|
| _Arg2_|Required| **Double**|The population standard deviation for the data range and is assumed to be known.|
| _Arg3_|Required| **Double**|The sample size.|

## Return value

Double


## Remarks

The confidence interval is a range of values. Your sample mean, x , is at the center of this range and the range is x = Confidence_Norm. For example, if x is the sample mean of delivery times for products ordered through the mail, x = Confidence_Norm is a range of population means. For any population mean, = 0 , in this range, the probability of obtaining a sample mean further from =0 than x is greater than alpha; for any population mean, ?0 , not in this range, the probability of obtaining a sample mean further from =0 than x is less than alpha. In other words, assume that x , standard_dev, and size is used to construct a two-tailed test at significance level alpha of the hypothesis that the population mean is =0 . Then we will not reject that hypothesis if =0 is in the confidence interval and will reject that hypothesis if =0 is not in the confidence interval. The confidence interval does not allow inference that there is probability 1 = alpha that the next package will take a delivery time that is in the confidence interval:


- If any argument is nonnumeric, Confidence_Norm generates an error.
    
- If alpha = 0 or alpha = 1, Confidence_Norm generates an error.
    
- If standard_dev = 0, Confidence_Norm generates an error.
    
- If size is not an integer, it is truncated.
    
- If size < 1, Confidence_Norm generates an error.
    
- If it is assumed that alpha equals 0.05, calculate the area under the standard normal curve that equals (1 - alpha), or 95 percent. This value is = 1.96. The confidence interval is therefore:
