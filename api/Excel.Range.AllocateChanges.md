# Range.AllocateChanges method (Excel)

Performs a writeback operation for all edited cells in a range based on an OLAP data source.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AllocateChanges`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[Range](Excel.Range(object).md)' object.


## Remarks

The  **AllocateChanges** method will execute an **UPDATE CUBE** statement for all changes made in the range since the last apply changes operation was committed. This method generates a run-time error if it is executed on a range based on a non-OLAP data source.
