# Selection.SwapEnds Method (Visio)

Swaps the begin and endpoints of a one-dimensional (1-D) shape.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `SwapEnds`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Selection](./Visio.Selection.md) object.


## Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

The type of glue associated with the endpoints is also swapped. For example, if the begin point of a 1-D shape is glued to object A and the endpoint of the 1-D shape is not glued, after invoking the  **SwapEnds** method, the endpoint is glued to object A and the begin point is not glued.
