# AddressList object (Outlook)

Represents an address book that contains a set of  **[AddressEntry](Outlook.AddressEntry.md)** objects.


## Remarks

The **AddressList** object is an address book that contains a set of **[AddressEntry](Outlook.AddressEntry.md)** objects.

The **AddressList** object supplies a list of address entries to which a messaging system can deliver messages. An **AddressList** object represents one address book container available under the transport provider's address book hierarchy for the current session. The entire hierarchy is available through the parent **[AddressLists](Outlook.AddressLists.md)** object.


## Example

The following example retrieves an **AddressList** object that represents the Personal Address List.


```vb
Set myAddressList = Application.Session.AddressLists("Personal Address Book")
```
