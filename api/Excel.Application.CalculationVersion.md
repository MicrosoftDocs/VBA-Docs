# Application.CalculationVersion Property (Excel)

Returns a number whose rightmost four digits are the minor calculation engine version number, and whose other digits (on the left) are the major version of Microsoft Excel. Read-only  **Long** .


## Syntax

 _expression_. `CalculationVersion`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application(Graph property).md) object.

 blnFullCalc = False 
End If
