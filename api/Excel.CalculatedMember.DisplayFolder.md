# CalculatedMember.DisplayFolder property (Excel)

Returns the display folder name for a named set. Read-only


## Syntax

_expression_. `DisplayFolder`

_expression_ A variable that returns a '[CalculatedMember](Excel.CalculatedMember.md)' object.


## Return value

 **String**


## Remarks

The value of this property corresponds to the optional value that can be entered in the **Display folder** text box of the **New/Modify Set** dialog box when a named set is created or edited. To create a new named set from data in a PivotTable based on an OLAP data source, click the PivotTable, click **Field, Items, & Sets** on the **PivotTable Tools Options** tab on the ribbon, click **Manage Sets**, click **New** in the ** Set Manager** dialog box, and then click **Create Set using MDX**. This will display the **New Set** dialog box, which contains the **Display folder** text box. Similarly, if you select an existing named set in the **Set Manager** dialog box, and then click **Edit**, the **Modify Set** dialog box is displayed.

This property along with the **[Dynamic](Excel.CalculatedMember.Dynamic.md)** and **[HierarchizeDistinct](Excel.CalculatedMember.HierarchizeDistinct.md)** properties can only be read for named sets (which are represented by **[CalculatedMember](Excel.CalculatedMember.md)** objects where the **[Type](Excel.CalculatedMember.Type.md)** property equals **xlCalculatedSet**). These properties for cannot be read for calculated members or measures (which are represented by **CalculatedMember** objects where the **Type** property equals **xlCalculatedMember**). If you attempt to read these properties for calculated members or measures, a run-time error is raised.
