# QueryTable.Refresh method (Excel)

Updates an external data range (**[QueryTable](Excel.QueryTable.md)**).


## Syntax

_expression_. `Refresh`( `_BackgroundQuery_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [QueryTable](Excel.QueryTable.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _BackgroundQuery_|Optional| **Variant**|Used only with  **QueryTables** that are based on the results of a SQL query. **True** to return control to the procedure as soon as a database connection is made and the query is submitted. The **QueryTable** is updated in the background. **False** to return control to the procedure only after all data has been fetched to the worksheet. If this argument isn't specified, the setting of the **[BackgroundQuery](Excel.QueryTable.BackgroundQuery.md)** property determines the query mode.|

## Return value

Boolean


## Remarks

The following remarks apply to  **QueryTable** objects that are based on the results of a SQL query.

The  **Refresh** method causes Microsoft Excel to connect to the data source of the **QueryTable** object, execute the SQL query, and return data to the range that is based on the **QueryTable** object. Unless this method is called, the **QueryTable** object doesn't communicate with the data source.

When making the connection to the OLE DB or ODBC data source, Microsoft Excel uses the connection string specified by the  **[Connection](Excel.QueryTable.Connection.md)** property. If the specified connection string is missing required values, dialog boxes will be displayed to prompt the user for the required information. If the **[DisplayAlerts](Excel.Application.DisplayAlerts.md)** property is **False** , dialog boxes aren't displayed and the **Refresh** method fails with the Insufficient Connection Information exception.

After Microsoft Excel makes a successful connection, it stores the completed connection string so that prompts won't be displayed for subsequent calls to the  **Refresh** method during the same editing session. You can obtain the completed connection string by examining the value of the **[Connection](Excel.QueryTable.Connection.md)** property.

After the database connection is made, the SQL query is validated. If the query isn't valid, the  **Refresh** method fails with the SQL Syntax Error exception.

If the query requires parameters, the  **[Parameters](Excel.Parameters.md)** collection must be initialized with parameter binding information before the **Refresh** method is called. If not enough parameters have been bound, the **Refresh** method fails with the Parameter Error exception. If parameters are set to prompt for their values, dialog boxes are displayed to the user regardless of the setting of the **[DisplayAlerts](Excel.Application.DisplayAlerts.md)** property. If the user cancels a parameter dialog box, the **Refresh** method halts and returns **False**. If extra parameters are bound with the **Parameters** collection, these extra parameters are ignored.

The  **Refresh** method returns **True** if the query is successfully completed or started; it returns **False** if the user cancels a connection or parameter dialog box.

To see whether the number of fetched rows exceeded the number of available rows on the worksheet, examine the  **[FetchedRowOverflow](Excel.QueryTable.FetchedRowOverflow.md)** property. This property is initialized every time the **Refresh** method is called.
