# Selection.Orientation property (Word)

Returns or sets the orientation of text in a selection when the Text Direction feature is enabled. Read/write  **WdTextOrientation**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Orientation**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Selection](Word.Selection.md)** object.


## Remarks

Some of the  **WdTextOrientation** constants may not be available to you, depending on the language support (U.S. English, for example) that you've selected or installed.

You can set the orientation for a text frame or for a selection that happens to occur inside a text frame. For information about the difference between a text frame and a text box, see the  **[TextFrame](Word.TextFrame.md)** object.
