# Application.WorkbookRowsetComplete Event (Excel)

The  **WorkbookRowsetComplete** event occurs when the user either drills through the recordset or invokes the rowset action on an OLAP PivotTable.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `WorkbookRowsetComplete`( `_Wb_` , `_Description_` , `_Sheet_` , `_Success_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application(Graph property).md) object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Wb_|Required| **Workbook**|The workbook for which the event occurs.|
| _Description_|Required| **String**|A brief description of the event.|
| _Sheet_|Required| **String**|The worksheet on which the recordset is created.|
| _Success_|Required| **Boolean**|Contains a Boolean value to indicate success or failure.|

## Remarks

Because the recordset is created asynchronously, the event allows automation to determine when the action has been completed. Additionally, because the recordset is created on a separate sheet, the event needs to be on the workbook level.
