# ExchangeUser.GetPicture Method (Outlook)

Obtains an  **[IPictureDisp](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms680762%28VS.85%29.aspx)** object that represents the picture of the Microsoft Exchange user that is displayed in Microsoft Outlook.


## Syntax

_expression_. `GetPicture`

_expression_ A variable that represents an '[ExchangeUser](Outlook.ExchangeUser.md)' object.


## Return value

An  **IPictureDisp** object that represents the picture of the Exchange user that is displayed in Outlook.


## Remarks

The picture of the Exchange user is stored in Active Directory and displayed in various places in Outlook, including the dialog box for  **Outlook Properties** and Contact Card.

If the picture does not exist for the user,  **GetPicture** returns **Null** (**Nothing** for Visual Basic).

You can only call  **GetPicture** from code that runs in-process as Outlook. An **StdPicture** object cannot be marshaled across process boundaries. If you attempt to call **GetPicture** from out-of-process code, an exception occurs. For more information, see [An automation server cannot pass a pointer to the picture object's IPictureDisp implementation across process boundaries](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/150034).
