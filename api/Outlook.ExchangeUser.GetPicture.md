# ExchangeUser.GetPicture method (Outlook)

Obtains an **[IPictureDisp](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-ipicturedisp)** object that represents the picture of the Microsoft Exchange user that is displayed in Microsoft Outlook.


## Syntax

_expression_.**GetPicture**

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[ExchangeUser](Outlook.ExchangeUser.md)** object.


## Return value

An **IPictureDisp** object that represents the picture of the Exchange user that is displayed in Outlook.


## Remarks

The picture of the Exchange user is stored in Active Directory and displayed in various places in Outlook, including the dialog box for  **Outlook Properties** and Contact Card.

If the picture does not exist for the user,  **GetPicture** returns **Null** (**Nothing** for Visual Basic).
