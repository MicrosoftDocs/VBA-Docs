# View Object (Publisher)

Contains the view attributes (show all, field shading, table gridlines, and so on) for a window or pane.
 


## Example

Use the  **[ActiveView](Publisher.Document.ActiveView.md)** property to return the **View** object. The following example specifies the zoom setting.
 

 

```vb
Sub ZoomFitSelection() 
 ActiveDocument.ActiveView.Zoom = pbZoomFitSelection

The following example scrolls the active view to the specified shape.
 

 



```vb
