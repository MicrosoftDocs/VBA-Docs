# ExchangeDistributionList.AddressEntryUserType property (Outlook)

Returns  **olExchangeDistributionListAddressEntry** which is a constant from the **[OlAddressEntryUserType](Outlook.OlAddressEntryUserType.md)** enumeration representing the user type of the **[ExchangeDistributionList](Outlook.ExchangeDistributionList.md)**. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AddressEntryUserType`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [ExchangeDistributionList](Outlook.ExchangeDistributionList.md) object.


## Remarks

The **ExchangeDistributionList** object is derived from the **[AddressEntry](Outlook.AddressEntry.md)** object. It inherits the **AddressEntryUserType** property from the **AddressEntry** object. In the case of **ExchangeDistributionList**, **AddressEntryUserType** should always return **olExchangeDistributionListAddressEntry**.
