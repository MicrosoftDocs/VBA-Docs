# Application.DeferRelationshipRecalc Property (Visio)

Determines whether Microsoft Visio defers recalculating shape sizes and relationships when a member of the relationship pair is moved or resized. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `DeferRelationshipRecalc`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an '[Application](Visio.Application.md)' object.


### Return value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks

For example, if you resize a shape that is a member of a container in a structured diagram, Visio will not adjust the size of the container if  **DeferRelationshipRecalc** is **True** . When you set **DeferRelationshipRecalc** to **False** , Visio recalculates the container size and adjusts it accordingly. (In each case, the container's **[ResizeAsNeeded](Visio.ContainerProperties.ResizeAsNeeded.md)** property must be set to **visContainerAutoResizeExpandContract** .)

Setting  **DeferRelationshipRecalc** to **False** causes Visio to immediately process all deferred actions.
