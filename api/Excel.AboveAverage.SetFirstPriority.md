# AboveAverage.SetFirstPriority Method (Excel)

Sets the priority value for this conditional formatting rule to "1" so that it will be evaluated before all other rules on the worksheet.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `SetFirstPriority`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [AboveAverage](Excel.AboveAverage.md) object.


## Remarks

When you have multiple conditional formatting rules in a worksheet, if the rule was not previously set to priority "1", this method will cause the priority of all other existing rules on the worksheet to be increased by one.


 **Note**  Priority levels for conditional formatting rules are applied on a worksheet-level basis.
