# Conversation.GetTable method (Outlook)

Returns a **[Table](Outlook.Table.md)** object that contains rows that represent all items in the conversation.


## Syntax

_expression_. `GetTable`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[Conversation](Outlook.Conversation.md)' object.


## Return value

A **Table** object that contains rows that represent all items in the conversation.


## Remarks

The **GetTable** method returns a **Table** that has all items of the conversation as the rows. The default set of columns is shown in the following table.



|**Column**|**Property**|
|:-----|:-----|
|1| **EntryID**|
|2| **Subject**|
|3| **CreationTime**|
|4| **LastModificationTime**|
|5| **MessageClass**|

By default, the rows in the table are sorted by the  **ConversationIndex** property of the items.

To modify the default column set, use the  **[Add](Outlook.Columns.Add.md)**, **[Remove](Outlook.Columns.Remove.md)**, or **[RemoveAll](Outlook.Columns.RemoveAll.md)** methods of the **[Columns](Outlook.Columns.md)** collection object.

The **Table** object returned by this **GetTable** method does not include items in the conversation that have been moved to the Deleted Items folder.


## Example

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code example,  `DemoConversationTable`, assumes that there is a mail item opened in an inspector.  `DemoConversationTable` gets a **[Conversation](Outlook.Conversation.md)** object based on this mail item, and calls the **GetTable** method to get a **Table** of all the conversation items. To get specific information for each item in the conversation, which can span across stores, `DemoConversationTable` adds the store entry ID property, `https://schemas.microsoft.com/mapi/proptag/0x0FFB0102`, as a column to the table. As `DemoConversationTable` enumerates each item (represented by a row) in the table, it uses the store entry ID property that corresponds to that item to call the **[GetItemFromID](Outlook.NameSpace.GetItemFromID.md)** method of the **[NameSpace](Outlook.NameSpace.md)** object to obtain the item object. The example then displays the subject and the number of attachments for that item.


> [!NOTE] 
> Enumerating the conversation works only if the Outlook account is connected to a Microsoft Exchange Server that is running at least Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, or Outlook is running in cached mode against Microsoft Exchange Server 2007.


```vb
Sub DemoConversationTable() 
 Dim oConv As Outlook.Conversation 
 Dim oTable As Outlook.Table 
 Dim oRow As Outlook.Row 
 Dim oMail As Outlook.MailItem 
 Dim oItem As Outlook.MailItem 
 Const PR_STORE_ENTRYID As String = _ 
 "https://schemas.microsoft.com/mapi/proptag/0x0FFB0102" 
 
 On Error Resume Next 
 ' Obtain the current item for the active inspector. 
 Set oMail = Application.ActiveInspector.CurrentItem 
 
 If Not (oMail Is Nothing) Then 
 ' Obtain the Conversation object. 
 Set oConv = oMail.GetConversation 
 If Not (oConv Is Nothing) Then 
 Set oTable = oConv.GetTable 
 oTable.Columns.Add (PR_STORE_ENTRYID) 
 Do Until oTable.EndOfTable 
 Set oRow = oTable.GetNextRow 
 ' Use EntryID and StoreID to open the item. 
 Set oItem = Application.session.GetItemFromID( _ 
 oRow("EntryID"), _ 
 oRow.BinaryToString(PR_STORE_ENTRYID)) 
 Debug.Print oItem.Subject, _ 
 "Attachments.Count=" & oItem.Attachments.count 
 Loop 
 End If 
 End If 
End Sub
