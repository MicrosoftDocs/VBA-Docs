# PivotField.Hidden property (Excel)

This property is used to hide the individual levels of an OLAP hierarchy. Read/write  **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Hidden`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [PivotField](Excel.PivotField.md) object.


## Remarks

 Returns **True** for hidden levels and **False** for visible (non-hidden) levels.

This property is applicable only to levels of OLAP hierarchies.

For relational data sources and OLAP attributes, this property is always  **False**. Trying to set it to **True** for an attribute or a relational field will return a run-time error. It is not possible to set this property to **True** for a level if all other levels of the same hierarchy already have this setting set to **True**. At least one level of a hierarchy has to have this property set to **False**. Attempting to do this will return a run-time error.
