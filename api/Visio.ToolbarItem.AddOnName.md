# ToolbarItem.AddOnName Property (Visio)

Gets or sets the name of an add-on or procedure that is run when its associated toolbar button is clicked. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `AddOnName`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [ToolbarItem](./Visio.ToolbarItem.md) object.


## Return value

String


## Remarks


 **Note**  Starting with Visio, the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface (UI) replaces the previous system of layered menus, toolbars, and task panes. VBA objects and members that you used to customize the user interface in previous versions of Visio are still available in Visio, but they function differently.

Assuming that the name of the add-on in the  **Addons** collection is _string_ , if the project of the currently active document (or another project if it is referenced) does not have a procedure named _string_ , or if the arguments passed in _string_ do not match those specified in the procedure, Microsoft Visio runs the add-on named _string_ . If no add-on named _string_ can be found, Visio does nothing and reports no error. (You can use the **TraceFlags** property to monitor the procedures and add-ons that Visio attempts to run.)

If  _string_ is an add-on, use the **AddOnArgs** property to specify arguments to send to the add-on when it is run.

If  _string_ is a procedure, specify arguments using _procname(arguments)_ or _procname arguments_ .

When calling a procedure in a standard module it is recommended that you prefix the string with the module name that contains the procedure (for example,  _moduleName.procName_ ) because more than one module can have a procedure with the same name.

To call a procedure in a project other than the project of the active document, use the syntax  _projName.modName.procName_ (you must have explicitly set a reference to _projName_ in your Visual Basic project).

If the  **AddOnName** property is set, Visio ignores the object's **CmdNum** property.


 **Note**  Beginning with Visio 2002, the  **AddOnName** property cannot execute a string that contains arbitrary VBA code. To call code that in previous versions of Visio you would have passed to the **AddOnName** property, move the code to a procedure in a document's VBA project that is called from the **AddOnName** property.
