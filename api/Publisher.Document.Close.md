# Document.Close Method (Publisher)

Closes the current publication and creates a blank publication in its place.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Close**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **Document** object.


## Remarks

You can use the  **Close** method only on an open **Document** object in another instance of Microsoft Publisher. Attempting to close the active publication in the current instance of Publisher causes an error.


## Example

This example opens a publication in a new instance of Publisher for modification and then closes the publication. (Note that to make this example work, you must replace  _Filename_ with a valid file name .)


```vb
Sub ModifyAnotherPublication() 
 
 ' Create new instance of Publisher. 
 Dim appPub As New Publisher.Application 
 
 ' Open publication. 
 appPub.Open FileName:="Filename" 
 
 ' Put code here to modify the publication as necessary. 
 
 ' Close the publication. 
 appPub.ActiveDocument.Close 
 
 ' Release the other instance of Publisher. 
 Set appPub = Nothing 
 
End Sub
```
