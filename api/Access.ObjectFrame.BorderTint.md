# ObjectFrame.BorderTint property (Access)

Gets or sets the tint that is applied to the theme color in the **BorderColor** property of the specified object. Read/write **Single**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**BorderTint**

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[ObjectFrame](Access.ObjectFrame.md)** object.


## Remarks

The **BorderTint** property contains a numeric expression that can be used to lighten the theme color in the **BorderColor** property. The default value of the **BorderTint** property is 100, which is neutral, and does not change the theme color. 

To lighten the color, first determine the percentage by which to lighten from 1 to 100, and then subtract that value as a whole number from 100 and use the remainder. For example, to lighten the theme color by 75%, subtract 75 from 100 and use the remainder, which is 25.

This property is not surfaced in the property sheet.


## Example

The following code example lightens the **BorderColor** property by 75%.


```vb
Me.ctl.BorderTint=25
```
