# Sentences object (Word)

A collection of  **[Range](Word.Range.md)** objects that represent all the sentences in a selection, range, or document. There is no Sentence object.


## Remarks

Use the **Sentences** property to return the **Sentences** collection. The following example displays the number of sentences selected.


```vb
MsgBox Selection.Sentences.Count & " sentences are selected"
```

Use  **Sentences** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a **Range** object that represents a sentence. The index number represents the position of a sentence in the **Sentences** collection. The following example formats the first sentence in the active document.




```vb
With ActiveDocument.Sentences(1) 
 .Bold = True 
 .Font.Size = 24 
End With
```

The **Count** property for this collection in a document returns the number of items in the main story only. To count items in other stories use the collection with the **Range** object.

The **Add** method isn't available for the **Sentences** collection. Instead, use the **InsertAfter** or **InsertBefore** method to add a sentence to a **Range** object. The following example inserts a sentence after the first sentence in the active document.




```vb
ActiveDocument.Sentences(1).InsertAfter "The house is blue. "
```
