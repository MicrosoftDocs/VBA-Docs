# Document.SetCompatibilityMode method (Word)

Sets the compatibility mode for the document.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `SetCompatibilityMode`( `_Mode_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[Document](Word.Document.md)' object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Mode_|Required| **Long**|Specifies which version of Word to approximate. Use a constant from the [WdCompatibilityMode](Word.WdCompatibilityMode.md) enumeration as an argument for this parameter.|

## Remarks

When you open a document in Word that was created in a previous version of Word, Compatibility Mode is turned on. Compatibility Mode ensures that no new or enhanced features in Word are available while working with a document, so that people who edit the document using previous versions of Word will have full editing capabilities.


## Example

The following code example puts Word in Word 2003 Compatibility Mode.


```vb
ActiveDocument.SetCompatibilityMode (wdWord2003)
```
