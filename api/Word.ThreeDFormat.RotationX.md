# ThreeDFormat.RotationX property (Word)

Returns or sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the x-axis in degrees. Read/write  **Single**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `RotationX`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a '[ThreeDFormat](Word.ThreeDFormat.md)' object.


## Remarks

The **RotationX** property can be a value from - 90 through 90. A positive value indicates upward rotation; a negative value indicates downward rotation.

To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the y-axis, use the **[RotationY](Word.ThreeDFormat.RotationY.md)** property of the ThreeDFormat object. To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the z-axis, use the **[Rotation](Word.Shape.Rotation.md)** property of the **[Shape](Word.Shape.md)** object. To change the direction of the extrusion's sweep path without rotating the front face of the extrusion, use the **[SetExtrusionDirection](Word.ThreeDFormat.SetExtrusionDirection.md)** method.


## Example

This example adds three identical extruded ovals to the active document and sets their rotation around the x-axis to - 30, 0, and 30 degrees, respectively.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Shapes 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationX = -30 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 90, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationX = 0 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 150, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationX = 30 
 End With 
End With
```
