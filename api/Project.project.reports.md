    For Each oReport In ActiveProject.Reports
        msg = msg & oReport.Index & ": " & oReport.Name & vbCrLf
    Next oReport
        
    If ActiveProject.Reports.Count > 0 Then
        MsgBox Prompt:=msg, Title:=msgBoxTitle
    Else
        MsgBox Prompt:="This project contains no custom reports.", _
            Title:=msgBoxTitle
    End If
End Sub
