# PlaySoundRuleAction Object (Outlook)

Represents an action that plays a .wav file sound.


## Remarks

 **PlaySoundRuleAction** is derived from the **[RuleAction](Outlook.RuleAction.md)** object. Each rule is associated with a **[RuleActions](Outlook.RuleActions.md)** object which has a **[PlaySound](Outlook.RuleActions.PlaySound.md)** property. The **PlaySound** property always returns a **PlaySoundRuleAction** object. If the rule has an enabled rule action that plays a sound file, then **[PlaySoundRuleAction.Enabled](Outlook.PlaySoundRuleAction.Enabled.md)** property would be **True**.

For more information on specifying rule actions, see [Specify Rule Actions](../outlook/How-to/Rules/specifying-rule-actions.md).
