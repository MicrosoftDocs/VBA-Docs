# Forward Property

Returns or sets the number of periods (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends forward. Read/write  **Long**.


## Example

This example sets the number of units that the trendline extends forward and backward. The example should be run on a 2-D column chart that contains a single series with a trendline.


```vb
With myChart.SeriesCollection(1).Trendlines(1) 
 .Forward = 5 
 .Backward = .5 
End With
```
