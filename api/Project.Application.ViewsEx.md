# Application.ViewsEx method (Project)

Displays the **More Views** dialog box with the specified pane of the current view selected, which prompts the user to manage views.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ViewsEx`( `_ApplyTo_` )

 _expression_ An expression that returns an **[Application](Project.Application.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Value|Description|
|0|Primary (usually the top) pane of a split view|
|1|Secondary (usually the bottom) pane of a split view|
|4|Active pane|
|5|Primary pane, or the Timeline if it is active|
|

## Return value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks




> [!NOTE] 
> In a combination view, the primary pane is the view that remains when a details or secondary pane is closed. Usually the primary pane is at the top; however, the Timeline is a secondary pane, but it displays at the top. For example, with the Resource Sheet view, clicking  **Details** on the **View** tab of the Ribbon shows the secondary Resource Form pane on the bottom. Clicking **Timeline** closes the Resource Form at the bottom and opens the Timeline pane at the top.


## Example

If the current view includes the Timeline and the Gantt Chart, where the Timeline is the active pane, the following example shows  **Timeline** selected in the **More Views** dialog box.


```vb
application.ViewsEx ApplyTo:=5
```
