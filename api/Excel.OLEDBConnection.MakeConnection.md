# OLEDBConnection.MakeConnection method (Excel)

Establishes a connection for the specified OLE DB connection.


## Syntax

_expression_. `MakeConnection`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [OLEDBConnection](Excel.OLEDBConnection.md) object.


## Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

The  **MakeConnection** method can be used when a connection drops and the user wants to reestablish the connection.

Various objects and methods might return a run-time error if the connection is dropped. Use of this method assures a connection before executing other objects or methods.




 **Note**  Microsoft Excel might drop a connection temporarily in the course of a session (unknown to the VBA programmer), so this method proves useful.

This method will result in a run-time error if the  **[MaintainConnection](Excel.OLEDBConnection.MaintainConnection.md)** property of the specified OLE DB connection has been set to **False**.
