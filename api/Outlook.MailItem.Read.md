# MailItem.Read event (Outlook)

Occurs when an instance of the parent object is opened for editing by the user. 


## Syntax

_expression_. `Read`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [MailItem](Outlook.MailItem.md) object.


## Remarks

The **Read** event differs from the **[Open](Outlook.MailItem.Open.md)** event in that **Read** occurs whenever the user selects the item in a view that supports in-cell editing as well as when the item is being opened in an **[Inspector](Outlook.Inspector.md)**.


## Example

This Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example uses the  **Read** event to increment a counter that tracks how often an item is read.


```vb
Public WithEvents myItem As Outlook.MailItem 
 
 
 
Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myItem = Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentFolder.Items(1) 
 
 myItem.Display 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Sub myItem_Read() 
 
 Dim myProperty As Outlook.UserProperty 
 
 Set myProperty = myItem.UserProperties("ReadCount") 
 
 If (myProperty Is Nothing) Then 
 
 Set myProperty = myItem.UserProperties.Add("ReadCount", olNumber) 
 
 End If 
 
 myProperty.Value = myProperty.Value + 1 
 
 myItem.Save 
 
End Sub
```
