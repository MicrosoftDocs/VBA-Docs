# Document.Container property (Word)

Returns the object that represents the container application for the specified document. Read-only  **Object**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Container`

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Document](Word.Document.md)** object.


## Remarks

The **Container** property provides access to the specified document's container application if the document is embedded in another application as an OLE object. This property also provides a pathway into the object model of the container application if a Word document is opened as an ActiveX document â€” for example, when a Word document is opened in Microsoft Office Binder or Internet Explorer.


## Example

This example displays the name of the container application for the first shape in the active document. For the example to work, this shape must be an OLE object.


```vb
Msgbox ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).OLEFormat.Object.Container.Name
```
