# XMLNode.ValidationStatus property (Word)

 Returns a **WdXMLValidationStatus** constant that represents whether an element or attribute is valid according to the attached schema.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ValidationStatus`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[XMLNode](Word.XMLNode.md)' object.


## Remarks

This property can return either of the two following  **WdXMLValidationStatus** constants.



| **wdXMLValidationStatusCustom**|Indicates that the **SetValidationError** method was used to set **ValidationErrorText** property to a custom text string.|
| **wdXMLValidationStatusOK**|Indicates an XML element or attribute is valid according to the attached schema.|

While these are the only two named constants the **ValidationStatus** property allows, there are many more unnamed values that come from the MSXML 5.0 component included with Microsoft Word. For a more complete list of possible values and their corresponding meaning, refer to the Microsoft Word XML schema reference on the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Web site.


## Example

The following example checks each element in the active document and displays a message containing the elements that do not validate according to the schema and a description of why.


```vb
Dim objNode As XMLNode 
Dim strValid As String 
 
For Each objNode In ActiveDocument.XMLNodes 
 objNode.Validate 
 If objNode.ValidationStatus <> wdXMLValidationStatusOK Then 
 strValid = strValid & objNode.BaseName & vbTab & _ 
 objNode.ValidationErrorText & vbCrLf 
 End If 
Next 
 
MsgBox "The following elements do not validate against " & _ 
 "the schema." & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & strValid & vbCrLf & _ 
 "You should fix these elements before continuing."
```
