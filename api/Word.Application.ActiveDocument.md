# Application.ActiveDocument property (Word)

Returns a  **[Document](Word.Document.md)** object that represents the active document (the document with the focus). If there are no documents open, an error occurs. Read-only.


 **Note**  The document in the active protected view window cannot be accessed using this property. Instead, use the [Document](Word.Document.md) property of the **[ActiveProtectedViewWindow](Word.Application.ActiveProtectedViewWindow.md)** object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ActiveDocument`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an '[Application](Word.Application.md)' object.


## Example

This example displays the name of the active document, or if there are no documents open, it displays a message.


```vb
If Application.Documents.Count >= 1 Then 
    MsgBox ActiveDocument.Name 
Else 
    MsgBox "No documents are open" 
End If
```

This example collapses the selection to an insertion point and then creates a range for the next five characters in the selection.




```vb
Dim rngTemp As Range 
 
Selection.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseStart 
Set rngTemp = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=Selection.Start, _ 
    End:=Selection.Start + 5)
```

This example inserts texts at the beginning of the active document and then prints the document.




```vb
Dim rngTemp As Range 
 
Set rngTemp = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=0, End:=0) 
With rngTemp 
    .InsertBefore "Company Report" 
    .Font.Name = "Arial" 
    .Font.Size = 24 
    .InsertParagraphAfter 
End With 
 
ActiveDocument.PrintOut
```
