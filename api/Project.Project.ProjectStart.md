# Project.ProjectStart Property (Project)

Gets or sets the start date for a project. Read/write  **Variant**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ProjectStart`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Project](./Project(enumerations).md) object.


## Remarks

Setting  **ProjectStart** value also causes the project to be scheduled from its start date. This has the same effect as setting the **ScheduleFromStart** property to **True**.
