# Curve.PointAndDerivatives Method (Visio)

Returns a point and its derivatives at a position along a curve's path.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `PointAndDerivatives`( `_t_` , `_n_` , `_x_` , `_y_` , `_dxdt_` , `_dydt_` , `_ddxdt_` , `_ddydt_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Curve](./Visio.Curve.md) object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _t_|Required| **Double**|The value in the curve's parameter domain to evaluate.|
| _n_|Required| **Integer**|0: get point; 1: point and 1st derivative; 2: point plus first and second derivative.|
| _x_|Required| **Double**|Returns  _x_ value of curve at _t._|
| _y_|Required| **Double**|Returns  _y_ value of curve at _t_.|
| _dxdt_|Required| **Double**|Returns first derivative ( _dx/dt_) at  _t_ if _n_ > 0.|
| _dydt_|Required| **Double**|Returns first derivative ( _dy/dt_) at  _t_ if _n_> 0.|
| _ddxdt_|Required| **Double**|Returns second derivative ( _ddx/dt_) at  _t_ if _n_> 1.|
| _ddydt_|Required| **Double**|Returns second derivative ( _ddy/dt_) at  _t_ if _n_> 1.|

### Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

Use the  **PointAndDerivatives** method of the **Curve** object to obtain the coordinates of a point within the curve's parameter domain and its first and second derivatives.

A  **Curve** object is described in terms of its parameter domain, which is the range [Start(),End()]. The **PointAndDerivatives** method can be used to extrapolate the curve's path outside [Start(),End()].


## Example

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro draws an oval on the document's active page and then retrieves it and iterates through its  **Paths** collection and each **Path** object to display the coordinates of various points along the curve. Because the shape drawn is an oval, it contains only one path and only one **Curve** object.
