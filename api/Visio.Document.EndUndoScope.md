# Document.EndUndoScope Method (Visio)

Ends or cancels a transaction that has a unique scope.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `EndUndoScope`( `_nScopeID_` , `_bCommit_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Document](./Visio.Document.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _nScopeID_|Required| **Long**|The ID of the scope to close.|
| _bCommit_|Required| **Boolean**| flag indicating that the changes made during the scope should be accepted (**True**) or canceled (**False**).|

## Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

If you need to know whether events you receive are the result of a particular operation that you initiated, use the  **BeginUndoScope** and **EndUndoScope** methods to wrap your operation. In your event handlers, use the **IsInScope** property to test whether the scope ID returned by the **BeginUndoScope** method is part of the current context. Make sure you clear the scope ID you stored from the **BeginUndoScope** property when you receive the **ExitScope** event with that ID.

You must balance calls to the  **BeginUndoScope** method with calls to the **EndUndoScope** method. If you call the **BeginUndoScope** method, you should call the **EndUndoScope** method as soon as you are done with the actions that constitute your scope. Also, while actions to multiple documents should be robust within a single scope, closing a document may have the side effect of clearing the undo information for the currently open scope as well as clearing the undo and redo stacks. If that happens, passing _bCommit_ = **False** to **EndUndoScope** does not restore the undo information.

You can also use the  **BeginUndoScope** and **EndUndoScope** methods to add an action defined by an add-on to the Microsoft Visio undo stream. This is useful when you are operating from modeless scenarios where the initiating agent is part of an add-on's user interface or a modeless programmatic action.




 **Note**  Most Visio actions are already wrapped in internal undo scopes, so add-ons running within the application do not need to call this method.


## Example

This example shows how to use the  **EndUndoScope** method to end a transaction that has a unique scope ID for an instance of Visio.


```vb
 
Private WithEvents vsoApplication As Visio.Application 
Private lngScopeID As Long 
 
Public Sub EndUndoScope_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoShape As Visio.Shape 
 
 'Set the module-level application variable to 
 'trap Application-level events. 
 Set vsoApplication = Visio.Application 
 
 'Begin a scope and set the module-level variable. 
 lngScopeID = vsoApplication.BeginUndoScope("Draw Shapes") 
 
 'Draw three shapes. 
 Set vsoShape = ActivePage.DrawRectangle(1, 2, 2, 1) 
 
 ActivePage.DrawOval 3, 4, 4, 3 
 ActivePage.DrawLine 4, 5, 5, 4 
 
 'Change a cell to trigger a CellChanged event. 
 vsoShape.Cells("Width").Formula = 5 
 
 'End and commit this scope. 
 vsoApplication.EndUndoScope lngScopeID, True 
 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub vsoApplication_CellChanged(ByVal Cell As IVCell) 
 
 'Check to see if this cell change is the result of something 
 'happening within the scope. 
 If vsoApplication.IsInScope(lngScopeID) Then 
 Debug.Print Cell.Name & " changed in scope "; lngScopeID 
 End If 
 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub vsoApplication_EnterScope(ByVal app As IVApplication, _ 
 ByVal nScopeID As Long, _ 
 ByVal bstrDescription As 
 String) 
 
 If vsoApplication.CurrentScope = lngScopeID Then 
 Debug.Print "Entering my scope " & nScopeID 
 Else 
 Debug.Print "Enter Scope " & bstrDescription & "(" & nScopeID & ")" 
 End If 
 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub vsoApplication_ExitScope(ByVal app As IVApplication, _ 
 ByVal nScopeID As Long, _ 
 ByVal bstrDescription As String, _ 
 ByVal bErrOrCancelled As Boolean) 
 
 If vsoApplication.CurrentScope = lngScopeID Then 
 Debug.Print "Exiting my scope " & nScopeID 
 Else 
 Debug.Print "Exit Scope " & bstrDescription & "(" & nScopeID & ")" 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
