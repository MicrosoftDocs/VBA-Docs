# Chart.Activate Event (Excel)

Occurs when a workbook, worksheet, chart sheet, or embedded chart is activated.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Activate`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Chart](Excel.Chart-graph-object.md) object.


## Remarks

This event doesn't occur when you create a new window.

When you switch between two windows showing the same workbook, the WindowActivate event occurs, but the Activate event for the workbook doesn't occur.


## Example

This example sorts the range A1:A10 when the worksheet is activated.


```vb
Private Sub Worksheet_Activate() 
 Range("a1:a10").Sort Key1:=Range("a1"), Order:=xlAscending 
End Sub
```
