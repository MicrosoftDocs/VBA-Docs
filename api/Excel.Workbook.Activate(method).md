# Workbook.Activate method (Excel)

Activates the first window associated with the workbook.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Activate`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Workbook](./Excel.Workbook.md) object.


## Remarks

This method won't run any Auto_Activate or Auto_Deactivate macros that might be attached to the workbook (use the  **[RunAutoMacros](Excel.Workbook.RunAutoMacros.md)** method to run those macros).


## Example

This example activates Book4.xls. If Book4.xls has multiple windows, the example activates the first window, Book4.xls:1.


```vb
Workbooks("BOOK4.XLS").Activate
```
