# ShapeRange.LeftRelative property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the relative left position of a range of shapes. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `LeftRelative`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **[ShapeRange](Word.shaperange.md)** object.


## Remarks

Use this property with the **[RelativeHorizontalPosition](Word.ShapeRange.RelativeHorizontalPosition.md)** property. When set to **wdShapePositionRelativeNone** (-999999) (see the **[WdShapePositionRelative](Word.WdShapePositionRelative.md)** enumeration), this property should be ignored because the shape does not use percent positioning. The horizontal position is solely determined by the **[Left](Word.ShapeRange.Left.md)** property.
