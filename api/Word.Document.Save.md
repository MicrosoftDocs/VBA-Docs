# Document.Save method (Word)

Saves the specified document.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Save**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Document](Word.Document.md)** object.
 
**Parameters:**

_NoPrompt_ (Optional)

If `true`, then Word automatically saves all documents.
If `false`, then Word prompts the user to save each document that has changed since it was last saved.

_OriginalFormat_ (Optional)

Specifies the way the documents are saved. Can be one of the WdOriginalFormat constants.

## Remarks

If a document has not been saved before, the **Save As** dialog box prompts the user for a file name.


## Example

This example saves the active document if it has changed since it was last saved.


```vb
If ActiveDocument.Saved = False Then ActiveDocument.Save
```

This example saves each document in the **Documents** collection without first prompting the user.




```vb
Documents.Save NoPrompt:=True, _ 
 OriginalFormat:=wdOriginalDocumentFormat
```
