# ShapeRange.Ungroup method (Word)

Ungroups any grouped shapes in the specified range of shapes, disassembles pictures and OLE objects within the specified shape or range of shapes, and returns the ungrouped shapes as a single  **ShapeRange** object.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Ungroup**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[ShapeRange](Word.shaperange.md)** object.


## Return value

ShapeRange


## Remarks

Because a group of shapes is treated as a single object, grouping and ungrouping shapes changes the number of items in the **Shapes** collection and changes the index numbers of items that come after the ungrouped shapes in the collection.
