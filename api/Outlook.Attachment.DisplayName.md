 Set myInspector = Application.ActiveInspector 
 
 If Not TypeName(myInspector) = "Nothing" Then 
 
 If TypeName(myInspector.CurrentItem) = "MailItem" Then 
 
 Set myItem = myInspector.CurrentItem 
 
 Set myAttachments = myItem.Attachments 
 
 'Prompt the user for confirmation 
 
 Dim strPrompt As String 
 
 strPrompt = "Are you sure you want to save the first attachment " & _ 
 
 "in the current item to the Documents folder? If a file with the " & _
