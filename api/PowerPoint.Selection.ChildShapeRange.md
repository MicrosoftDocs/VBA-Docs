```vb
Sub ChildShapes()

    Dim sldNew As Slide
    Dim shpCanvas As Shape

    'Create a new slide with a drawing canvas and shapes
    Set sldNew = Presentations(1).Slides _
        .Add(Index:=1, Layout:=ppLayoutBlank)

    Set shpCanvas = sldNew.Shapes.AddCanvas( _
        Left:=100, Top:=100, Width:=200, Height:=200)

    With shpCanvas.CanvasItems
        .AddShape msoShapeRectangle, Left:=0, Top:=0, _
            Width:=100, Height:=100
        .AddShape msoShapeOval, Left:=0, Top:=50, _
            Width:=100, Height:=100
        .AddShape msoShapeDiamond, Left:=0, Top:=100, _
            Width:=100, Height:=100
    End With

    'Select all shapes in the canvas
    shpCanvas.CanvasItems.SelectAll

    'Fill canvas child shapes with a pattern
    With ActiveWindow.Selection
        If .HasChildShapeRange = True Then
            .ChildShapeRange.Fill.Patterned Pattern:=msoPatternDivot
        Else
            MsgBox "This is not a range of child shapes."
        End If
    End With
	
End Sub
```
