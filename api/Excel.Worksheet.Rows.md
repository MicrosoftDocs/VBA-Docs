# Worksheet.Rows Property (Excel)

Returns a **[Range](Excel.Range(object).md)** object that represents all the rows on the specified worksheet. 


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Rows`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Worksheet](./Excel.Worksheet.md) object.


## Remarks

Using the `Rows` property without an object qualifier is equivalent to using  `ActiveSheet.Rows`. If the active document isn't a worksheet, the `Rows` property fails.

To return a single row, include an index in parentheses. For example, `Rows(1)` returns the first row.

## Example

This example deletes row three on Sheet1.


```vb
Worksheets("Sheet1").Rows(3).Delete
```

This example deletes rows in the current region on worksheet one where the value of cell one in the row is the same as the value in cell one in the previous row.




```vb
For Each rw In Worksheets(1).Cells(1, 1).CurrentRegion.Rows 
 this = rw.Cells(1, 1).Value 
 If this = last Then rw.Delete 
 last = this 
Next
```

This example displays the number of rows in the selection on Sheet1. If more than one area is selected, the example loops through each area.




```vb
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
areaCount = Selection.Areas.Count 
If areaCount <= 1 Then 
 MsgBox "The selection contains " & _ 
 Selection.Rows.Count & " rows." 
Else 
 i = 1 
 For Each a In Selection.Areas 
 MsgBox "Area " & i & " of the selection contains " & _ 
 a.Rows.Count & " rows." 
 i = i + 1 
 Next a 
End If
```
