## Example

This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see [Using Events with the Application Object](../word/Concepts/Objects-Properties-Methods/using-events-with-the-application-object-word.md)for directions on how to accomplish this.


```vb
Public WithEvents appWord as Word.Application 
 
Private Sub appWord_WindowActivate _ 
 (ByVal Doc As Word.Document, _
  ByVal Wn As Word.Window) 
 Wn.WindowState = wdWindowStateMaximize
