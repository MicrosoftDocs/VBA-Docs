# Speech.Speak method (Excel)

Microsoft Excel plays back the text string that is passed as an argument.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Speak`( `_Text_` , `_SpeakAsync_` , `_SpeakXML_` , `_Purge_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Speech](./Excel.Speech.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Text_|Required| **String**|The text to be spoken.|
| _SpeakAsync_|Optional| **Variant**| **True** will cause the _Text_ to be spoken asynchronously (the method will not wait of the Text to be spoken). **False** will cause the _Text_ to be spoken synchronously (the method waits for the _Text_ to be spoken before continuing). The default is **False**.|
| _SpeakXML_|Optional| **Variant**| **True** will cause the _Text_ to be interpreted as XML. **False** will cause the _Text_ to not be interpreted as XML, so any XML tags will be read and not interpreted. The default is **False**.|
| _Purge_|Optional| **Variant**| **True** will cause current speech to be terminated and any buffered text to be purged before _Text_ is spoken. **False** will not cause the current speech to be terminated and will not purge the buffered text before _Text_ is spoken. The default is **False**.|
