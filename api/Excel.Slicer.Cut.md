# Slicer.Cut method (Excel)

Cuts the specified slicer and copies it to the clipboard.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Cut`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[Slicer](Excel.Slicer.md)' object.


## Example

The following code example accesses the Customer slicer by using the  **[Range](Excel.Shapes.Range.md)** property of the **[Shapes](Excel.Shapes.md)** collection, and then cuts and pastes it into the active worksheet.


```vb
ActiveSheet.Shapes.Range(Array("Customer")).Select 
Selection.Cut 
ActiveSheet.Paste 

```

Alternatively, you can perform the same operation by using the  **[Slicers](Excel.SlicerCache.Slicers.md)** property of the **[SlicerCaches](Excel.SlicerCaches.md)** collection to access the slicer, as shown in the following code example.




```vb
ActiveWorkbook.SlicerCaches("Slicer_Customer") _ 
 .Slicers("Customer").Cut 
ActiveSheet.Paste
```
