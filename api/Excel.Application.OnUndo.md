# Application.OnUndo method (Excel)

Sets the text of the  **Undo** command and the name of the procedure that's run if you choose the **Undo** command after running the procedure that sets this property.


## Syntax

_expression_. `OnUndo`( `_Text_` , `_Procedure_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application-graph-property.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Text_|Required| **String**|The text that appears with the  **Undo** command.|
| _Procedure_|Required| **String**|The name of the procedure that's run when you choose the  **Undo** command.|

## Remarks

If a procedure doesn?t use the  **OnUndo** method, the **Undo** command is disabled.

The procedure must use the  **[OnRepeat](Excel.Application.OnRepeat.md)** and **OnUndo** methods last, to prevent the repeat and undo procedures from being overwritten by subsequent actions in the procedure.


## Example

This example sets the repeat and undo procedures.


```vb
Application.OnRepeat "Repeat VB Procedure", _ 
 "Book1.xls!My_Repeat_Sub" 
Application.OnUndo "Undo VB Procedure", _ 
 "Book1.xls!My_Undo_Sub"
```
