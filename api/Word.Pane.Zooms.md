# Pane.Zooms property (Word)

Returns a  **[Zooms](Word.zooms.md)** collection that represents the magnification options for each view (such as normal view, outline view or print layout view).


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Zooms`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a '[Pane](Word.Pane.md)' object.


## Remarks

For information about returning a single member of a collection, see [Returning an Object from a Collection](../word/Concepts/Miscellaneous/returning-an-object-from-a-collection-word.md).


## Example

This example sets the magnification in normal view to 100 percent for each open window.


```vb
Dim wndLoop as Window 
 
For Each wndLoop In Windows 
 wndLoop.ActivePane.Zooms(wdNormalView).Percentage = 100 
Next wndLoop
```

This example sets the magnification in print layout view so that an entire page is visible.




```vb
ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Panes(1).Zooms(wdPrintView).PageFit = _ 
 wdPageFitFullPage
```
