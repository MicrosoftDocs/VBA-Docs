# Document.SaveSubsetFonts property (Word)

 **True** if Microsoft Word saves a subset of the embedded TrueType fonts with the document. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `SaveSubsetFonts`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[Document](Word.Document.md)' object.


## Remarks

If fewer than 32 characters of a TrueType font are used in a document, Word embeds the subset (only the characters used) in the document. If more than 32 characters are used, Word embeds the entire font.


## Example

This example sets a document named "MyDoc" to save only a subset of its embedded TrueType fonts (when just a few characters are used), and then it saves "MyDoc."


```vb
With Documents("MyDoc") 
 .EmbedTrueTypeFonts = True 
 .SaveSubsetFonts = True 
 .Save 
End With
```
