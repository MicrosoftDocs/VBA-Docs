# Application.NewDocument Event (Word)

Occurs when a new document is created.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you are working with a document embedded within another document, this event will not occur.

## Syntax

Private Sub Application **_NewDocument**(ByVal **_Doc_** As Document)

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Word.Application.md) object that has been declared with events in a class module.


### Parameters

|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Doc_|Required| **Document**|The new document.|

## Remarks

For more information about using events with the **Application** object, see [Using Events with the Application Object](../word/Concepts/Objects-Properties-Methods/using-events-with-the-application-object-word.md).


## Example

This example asks the user whether to save all other open documents when a new document is created. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see [Using Events with the Application Object](../word/Concepts/Objects-Properties-Methods/using-events-with-the-application-object-word.md) for directions on how to accomplish this.


```vb
Public WithEvents appWord as Word.Application 
 
Private Sub appWord_NewDocument(ByVal Doc As Document) 
 Dim intResponse As Integer 
 Dim strName As String 
 Dim docLoop As Document 
 
 intResponse = MsgBox("Save all other documents?", vbYesNo) 
 
 If intResponse = vbYes Then 
 strName = ActiveDocument.Name 
 For Each docLoop In Documents 
 With docLoop 
 If .Name <> strName Then 
 .Save 
 End If 
 End With 
 Next docLoop 
 End If 
End Sub
```
