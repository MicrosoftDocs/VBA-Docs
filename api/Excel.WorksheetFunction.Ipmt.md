# WorksheetFunction.Ipmt method (Excel)

Returns the interest payment for a given period for an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Ipmt`( `_Arg1_` , `_Arg2_` , `_Arg3_` , `_Arg4_` , `_Arg5_` , `_Arg6_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [WorksheetFunction](./Excel.WorksheetFunction.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Arg1_|Required| **Double**|Rate - the interest rate per period.|
| _Arg2_|Required| **Double**|Per - the period for which you want to find the interest and must be in the range 1 to nper.|
| _Arg3_|Required| **Double**|Nper - the total number of payment periods in an annuity.|
| _Arg4_|Required| **Double**|Pv - the present value, or the lump-sum amount that a series of future payments is worth right now.|
| _Arg5_|Optional| **Variant**|Fv - the future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (the future value of a loan, for example, is 0).|
| _Arg6_|Optional| **Variant**|Type - the number 0 or 1 and indicates when payments are due. If type is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.|

## Return value

Double


## Remarks



|**Set type equal to**|**If payments are due**|
|:-----|:-----|
|0|At the end of the period|
|1|At the beginning of the period|

- Make sure that you are consistent about the units you use for specifying rate and nper. If you make monthly payments on a four-year loan at 12 percent annual interest, use 12%/12 for rate and 4*12 for nper. If you make annual payments on the same loan, use 12% for rate and 4 for nper.
    
- For all the arguments, cash you pay out, such as deposits to savings, is represented by negative numbers; cash you receive, such as dividend checks, is represented by positive numbers.
