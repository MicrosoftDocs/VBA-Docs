# Dictionary.LanguageID property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **[WdLanguageID](Word.WdLanguageID.md)** constant that represents the language for the specified object. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_.**LanguageID**

_expression_ Required. An expression that returns a '[Dictionary](Word.Dictionary.md)' object.


## Remarks

For a custom dictionary, you must first set the **[LanguageSpecific](Word.Dictionary.LanguageSpecific.md)** property to **True** before specifying the **LanguageID** property. Custom dictionaries that are language-specific check only text that is formatted for that language.

Some  **WdLanguageID** constants may not be available to you, depending on the language support (U.S. English, for example) that you have selected or installed.
