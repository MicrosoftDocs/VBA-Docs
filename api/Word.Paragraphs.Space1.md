# Paragraphs.Space1 method (Word)

Single-spaces the specified paragraphs.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Space1`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Paragraphs](Word.paragraphs.md)' collection.


## Remarks

The exact spacing is determined by the font size of the largest characters in each paragraph.

You can also use the **[LineSpacingRule](Word.Paragraphs.LineSpacingRule.md)** property to set paragraph spacing. The following two statements are equivalent:




```vb
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs.Space1 
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs.LineSpacingRule = wdLineSpaceSingle
```


## Example

This example changes all paragraphs in the active document to single spacing.


```vb
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs.Space1
```
