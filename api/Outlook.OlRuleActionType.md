## Remarks

The list of rule action types in this enumeration includes all the rule actions that the Rules and Alerts Wizard supports. Note that while you can programmatically enumerate all the rule actions for a rule, you can programmatically create a rule with only the most commonly used rule actions. For more information, see [Specifying Rule Actions](../outlook/How-to/Rules/specifying-rule-actions.md).
