# Shape.WizardTag Property (Publisher)

Returns or sets a  **PbWizardTag**constant indicating the function of a specified shape with respect to its publication design. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **WizardTag**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


## Remarks

The  **WizardTag** property value can be one of the **[PbWizardTag](Publisher.PbWizardTag.md)** constants declared in the Microsoft Publisher type library.

The combination of the  **[WizardTagInstance](Publisher.Shape.WizardTagInstance.md)** property and the **WizardTag** property uniquely defines every shape in a publication.


## Example

The following example displays the wizard tag and wizard tag instance information for all the shapes on page one of the active publication.


```vb
Dim shpLoop As Shape 
 
For Each shpLoop In ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes 
 With shpLoop 
 Debug.Print "Shape: " & .Name 
 Debug.Print " Wizard tag: " & .WizardTag 
 Debug.Print " Wizard tag instance: " _ 
 & .WizardTagInstance 
 End With 
Next shpLoop
```
