# FormFields.Shaded property (Word)

 **True** if shading is applied to form fields. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Shaded`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a 'FormFields' collection object.


## Remarks

Shading makes form fields easier to locate in a document and doesn't affect the printed output.


## Example

This example removes shading from form fields in Employment Form.doc.


```vb
Documents("Employment Form.doc").FormFields.Shaded = False
```

This example adds shading to the form fields in the active document and protects the document for forms.




```vb
With ActiveDocument 
 .FormFields.Shaded = True 
 .Protect Type:=wdAllowOnlyFormFields, NoReset:=True 
End With
```
