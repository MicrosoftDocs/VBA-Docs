| **olCustomFoldersGroup**|0|Identifies a user-defined navigation group, added using either the Outlook user interface or an add-in.|
| **olFavoriteFoldersGroup**|4|Identifies the  **Favorite Folders** navigation group. This navigation group exists only within the **[NavigationGroups](Outlook.MailModule.NavigationGroups.md)** collection of a **[MailModule](Outlook.MailModule.md)** object and cannot be created in or accessed from other modules.|

| **olReadOnlyGroup**|6|Identifies a navigation group that is, by default, read-only and no folders can be added or removed from that navigation group. This does not imply the folders themselves are read-only, and write access to the folders depends on how the folders are set up.|
