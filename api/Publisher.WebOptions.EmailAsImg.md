## Syntax

 _expression_. **EmailAsImg**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an  **WebOptions** object.

## Remarks

This property can increase your message's compatibility with older email clients, but may result in larger file size.

The properties of the  **[WebOptions](Publisher.WebOptions.md)** object are used to specify the behavior of Web publications. This means that when any of these properties are modified, newly created Web publications will inherit the modified properties.

This property corresponds to the check box in the  **E-Mail Options** section of the **Web** tab of the **Options** dialog box.


## Example

The following example sets Microsoft Publisher to email publication pages as JPEG images.


```vb
Application.WebOptions.EmailAsImg = True
```
