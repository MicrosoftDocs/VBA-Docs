# PivotTable.CommitChanges Method (Excel)

Performs a commit operation on the data source of a PivotTable report based on an OLAP data source.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `CommitChanges`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[PivotTable](Excel.PivotTable.md)' object.


### Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

The  **CommitChanges** method sends a **COMMIT TRANSACTION** statement to the OLAP server, and clears all cells that were edited by entering a value, but will not clear formulas in value cells. This method generates a run-time error if it is executed on a PivotTable report based on a non-OLAP data source.
