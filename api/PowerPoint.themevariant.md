# ThemeVariant Object (PowerPoint)

Represents a variation (set of colors and fonts) in a theme.


## Example

This example opens a theme file, iterates through the variants in the theme, and prints the name and ID of each variation in the theme.


```vb
Sub IterateThemeVariants()

    Dim pptTheme As Theme
    Dim pptThemeVariants As ThemeVariants
    Dim pptThemeVariant As ThemeVariant
    Dim path As String
    
    ' Get a reference to the currently active theme.
    path = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Document Themes 15\" & _
        ActivePresentation.TemplateName & ".thmx"
    Set pptTheme = Application.OpenThemeFile(path)
    
    ' Get a reference to all of the variations in the theme.
    Set pptThemeVariants = pptTheme.ThemeVariants
    
    ' Iterate over each variation of the theme and print
    ' its name and ID.
    For Each pptThemeVariant In pptThemeVariants
    
        Debug.Print "Variation " & pptThemeVariant.name & " id: " & pptThemeVariant.Id
    
    Next pptThemeVariant

End Sub
```
