# Printers object (Access)

The  **Printers** collection contains **[Printer](Access.Printer.md)** objects representing all the printers available on the current system.


## Remarks

Use the  **[Printers](Access.Application.Printers.md)** property of the **Application** object to return the **Printers** collection. You can enumerate through the **Printers** collection by using the **For Each...Next** statement.

You can refer to an individual  **Printer** object in the **Printers** collection either by referring to the printer by name, or by referring to its index within the collection.

The  **Printers** collection is indexed beginning with zero. If you refer to a printer by its index, the first printer is Printers(0), the second printer is Printers(1), and so on.

You can't add or delete a  **Printer** object from the **Printers** collection.


## Example

The following example displays information about all the printers available to the system.


```vb
Dim prtLoop As Printer 
 
For Each prtLoop In Application.Printers 
 With prtLoop 
 MsgBox "Device name: " &amp; .DeviceName &amp; vbCr _ 
 &amp; "Driver name: " &amp; .DriverName &amp; vbCr _ 
 &amp; "Port: " &amp; .Port 
 End With 
Next prtLoop
```
