# Project.Activate event (Project)

Occurs when switching to the project from another project, including when the project is opened or created.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Activate** (_pj_)

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Project](project.project.md)** object.


## Parameters

|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _pj_|Required|**Project**|The project that was activated.|

## Remarks

When you switch between two windows showing the same project, the  **Activate** event for the project doesn't occur.

This event doesn't occur when you create a new window. 

Project events do not occur when the project is embedded in another document or application. 


## Example

The following example ensures that the project window is maximized whenever it is activated.


```vb
Private Sub Project_Activate(ByVal pj As MSProject.Project) 
    pj.Windows.ActiveWindow.WindowState = pjMaximized 
End Sub
```
