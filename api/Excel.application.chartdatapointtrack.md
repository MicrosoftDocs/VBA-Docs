# Application.ChartDataPointTrack property (Excel)

 **True** will cause all charts in newly created documents to use the cell reference tracking behavior. **Boolean**


## Syntax

_expression_. `ChartDataPointTrack`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Application](Excel.Application-graph-property.md) object.


## Notes

Data labels will now track the  _actual_ data point to which they are attached (as opposed to the legacy behavior of tracking the _index_ of the data point), allowing the label-to-point relationship to persist across events such as filter and sort.


## Property value

 **BOOL**
