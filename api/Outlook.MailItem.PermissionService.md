# MailItem.PermissionService property (Outlook)

Sets or returns an **[OlPermissionService](Outlook.OlPermissionService.md)** constant that determines the permission service that will be used when sending a message protected by Information Rights Management (IRM). Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `PermissionService`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [MailItem](Outlook.MailItem.md) object.


## Remarks

This property is useful only if you have more than one permission identity for a particular SMTP address. 

While you can view content that is protected by IRM on any computer running the 2007 Microsoft Office system or a later version, you must have Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, or a later version of Outlook to create or send an email that is protected by IRM.


## Example

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example demonstrates how to specify the permission service before sending an item. Replace 'Dan Wilson' with a valid recipient name before running this example.


```vb
Sub SendMyMail() 
 
 Set myItem = Outlook.CreateItem(olMailItem) 
 
 myItem.To = "Dan Wilson" 
 
 myItem.Subject = "Data files information" 
 
 myItem.Permission = olDoNotForward 
 
 myItem.PermissionService = olWindows 
 
 myItem.Send 
 
End Sub
```
