# Workbooks.Close method (Excel)

Closes the object.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Close`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Workbooks](./Excel.Workbooks.md) object.


## Remarks

Closing a workbook from Visual Basic doesn't run any Auto_Close macros in the workbook. Use the  **[RunAutoMacros](Excel.Workbook.RunAutoMacros.md)** method to run the auto close macros.


## Example

This example closes all open workbooks. If there are changes in any open workbook, Microsoft Excel displays the appropriate prompts and dialog boxes for saving changes.


```vb
Workbooks.Close
```
