# PublishObject.AutoRepublish property (Excel)

When a workbook is saved, Microsoft Excel determines if any item in the  **[PublishObjects](Excel.PublishObjects.md)** collection has the **AutoRepublish** property set to **True** and, if so, republishes it. The default value is **False**. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AutoRepublish`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [PublishObject](Excel.PublishObject.md) object.


## Example

This example publishes a range on a worksheet to an HTML file on the C: drive. When the user saves the workbook containing the worksheet, Excel will automatically republish the range to the same HTML file. This example assumes that the user has read/write access to the web page and that cells A1 through D10 in the worksheet have values in them.


```vb
Sub PublishToWeb() 
 
 With ActiveWorkbook.PublishObjects.Add( _ 
 SourceType:= xlSourceRange, _ 
 Filename:="C:\Work.htm", _ 
 Sheet:="Sheet1", _ 
 Source:="A1:D10", _ 
 HtmlType:=xlHtmlStatic, _ 
 DivID:="Book1.xls_130489") 
 .Publish 
 .AutoRepublish = True 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
