# Views.ViewRemove Event (Outlook)

Occurs when a view has been removed from the specified collection.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ViewRemove`( `_View_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Views](./Outlook.Views.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _View_|Required| **[View](Outlook.View.md)**|The view which was removed from the collection prior to this event.|

## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example displays the name of the view that has been removed from the collection when the  **ViewRemove** event is fired. The sample code must be placed in a class module such as `ThisOutlookSession`, and the  `DeleteView()` procedure should be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```vb
Public WithEvents objViews As Outlook.Views 
 
Sub DeleteView() 
 Set objViews = Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentFolder.Views 
 objViews.Item("New Table View").Delete 
End Sub 
 
Sub objViews_ViewRemove(ByVal View As View) 
 'Displays view name 
 MsgBox "The view: " & View.Name & " was removed programmatically." 
End Sub
```
