|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Direction_|Required| **[XlDirection](Excel.XlDirection.md)**|The direction in which the page break is dragged.|
| _RegionIndex_|Required| **Long**|The print-area region index for the page break (the region where the mouse pointer is located when the mouse button is pressed if the user drags the page break).

```vb
ActiveSheet.VPageBreaks(1).DragOff xlToRight, 1
```
