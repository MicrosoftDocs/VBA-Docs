# Assignment.Summary Property (Project)

Indicates whether the assignment is on a summary task. Read-only  **String**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Summary`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [Assignment](./Project.Assignment.md) object.


## Remarks

For an example that checks whether summary tasks have assignments, see the  **[Summary](Project.Task.Summary.md)** property for the **Task** object.


 **Note**  Project ignores the  **Summary** property for an assignment. The property value is always "No".
