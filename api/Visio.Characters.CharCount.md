# Characters.CharCount Property (Visio)

Returns the number of characters in an object. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `CharCount`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Characters](./Visio.Characters.md) object.


### Return value

Long


## Remarks

For a  **Shape** object, the **CharCount** property returns the number of characters in the shape's text. For a **Characters** object, the **CharCount** property returns the number of characters in the text range represented by that object.

The value returned by the  **CharCount** property includes the expanded number of characters for any fields in the object's text. For example, if the text contains a field that displays the file name of a drawing, the **CharCount** property includes the number of characters in the file name, rather than the one-character escape sequence used to represent a field in the **Text** property of a **Shape** object.
