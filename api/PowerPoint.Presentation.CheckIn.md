# Presentation.CheckIn Method (PowerPoint)

Returns a presentation from a local computer to a server, and sets the local file to read-only so that it cannot be edited locally.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `CheckIn`( `_SaveChanges_`, `_Comments_`, `_MakePublic_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Presentation](./PowerPoint.Presentation.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _SaveChanges_|Optional|**Boolean**|**True** saves the presentation to the server location. The default value is **False**.|
| _Comments_|Optional|**Variant**|Comments for the revision of the presentation being checked in (only applies if SaveChanges equals  **True**).|
| _MakePublic_|Optional|**Variant**|**True** allows the user to perform a publish on the presentation after being checked in. This submits the document for the approval process, which can eventually result in a version of the presentation being published to users with read-only rights to the presentation (only applies if SaveChanges equals **True**).|

## Remarks

To take advantage of the collaboration features built into Microsoft PowerPoint, presentations must be stored on a Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server.


## Example

This example checks the server to see if the specified presentation can be checked in and, if so, closes the presentation and checks it back into server.


```vb
Sub CheckInPresentation(strPresentation As String)

    If Presentations(strPresentation).CanCheckIn = True Then

        Presentations(strPresentation).CheckIn

        MsgBox strPresentation & " has been checked in."

    Else

        MsgBox strPresentation & " cannot be checked in at this time.  Please try again later."

    End If

End Sub
```

To call the subroutine above, use the following subroutine and replace the " _https://servername/workspace/report.ppt_ " file name with an actual file located on a server mentioned in the Remarks section above.




```vb
Sub CheckInPresentation()

    Call CheckInPresentation(strPresentation:= "https://servername/workspace/report.ppt ")

End Sub
```
