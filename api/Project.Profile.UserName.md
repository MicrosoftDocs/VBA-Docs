# Profile.UserName property (Project)

Gets or sets the logon name of the current account profile. Read/write  **String**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**UserName**

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Profile](./Project.Profile.md) object.


## Remarks

The **UserName** property of the **Profile** object shows the logon name. By comparison, the **[UserName](Project.Application.UserName.md)** property of the **Application** object shows the local user name.


## Example

If there are two account profiles, and the user named Jeff Smith logs on with the DOMAIN\jsmith account, the first statement in the following code shows  **DOMAIN\jsmith** in the **Immediate** pane of the VBE. The second statement shows **Jeff Smith**.


```vb
Debug.Print Profiles(2).UserName 
Debug.Print UserName
```
