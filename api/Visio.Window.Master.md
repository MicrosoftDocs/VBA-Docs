# Window.Master Property (Visio)

Gets the master that is displayed in a window. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Master`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Window](./Visio.Window.md) object.


## Return value

Variant


## Remarks

You can use the  **SubType** property of the **Window** object to determine whether the **Window** object shows a master. If the **Window** object does not show a master, the **Master** property raises an exception.

If the  **Window** object shows a master that is open for editing, the master returned is the temporary master being edited, not the original master that was opened for editing.
