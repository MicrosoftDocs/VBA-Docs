# Permission.Enabled property (Office)

Gets or sets a  **Boolean** value that indicates whether permissions are enabled on the active document. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Enabled`

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Permission](Office.Permission.md)' object.


## Remarks

Use the  **Enabled** property to determine whether permissions are restricted on the active document, and to enable or disable permissions. Set Enabled to **False** to disable permissions and to remove all users, other than the document author, and their permissions.

When permissions are disabled, the  **Count** property of the **Permission** object returns 0 (zero); however, when permissions are re-enabled, the permissions of the document author remain intact.
