# Series.HasErrorBars Property (PowerPoint)

 **True** if the series has error bars. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `HasErrorBars`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[Series](PowerPoint.Series.md)' object.


## Remarks

This property is not available for 3-D charts. 


## Example




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

The following example removes error bars from series one for the first chart in the active document. You should run the example on a 2-D line chart that has error bars for series one.




```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        .Chart.SeriesCollection(1).HasErrorBars = False

    End If

End With
```
