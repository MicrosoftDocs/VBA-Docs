# ShapeRange.Group method (Excel)

Groups the shapes in the specified range.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Group`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [ShapeRange](./Excel.ShapeRange.md) object.


## Return value

A  **[Shape](Excel.Shape.md)** object that represents the grouped shape.


## Remarks

Because a group of shapes is treated as a single shape, grouping and ungrouping shapes changes the number of items in the  **[Shapes](Excel.Shapes.md)** collection and changes the index numbers of items that come after the affected items in the collection.

The  **[Range](Excel.Range(object).md)** object must be a single cell in the PivotTable field's data range. If you attempt to apply this method to more than one cell, it will fail (without displaying an error message).
