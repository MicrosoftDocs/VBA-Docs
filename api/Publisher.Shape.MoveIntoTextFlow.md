|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Range|Required| **TextRange**|The range of text before which the given shape is inserted.|

- Inline shapes

## Example

The following example checks if the second shape on the second page of the publication is inline, and if it is not, inserts it inline at the beginning of the text flow of the given text range. 


```vb
Dim theShape As Shape 
Dim theRange As TextRange 
 
Set theRange = ActiveDocument.Pages(2).Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange 
Set theShape = ActiveDocument.Pages(2).Shapes(2) 
 
If Not theShape.IsInline = msoTrue Then 
 theShape.MoveIntoTextFlow Range:=theRange 
End If 

```
