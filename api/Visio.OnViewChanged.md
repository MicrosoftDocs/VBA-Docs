 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Viewer** object.

## Example

The following code shows how to use the  **OnViewChanged** event to display the new page-view data in the **Immediate** window.


```vb
Private Sub vsoViewer_OnViewChanged(ByVal PageXAtViewCenter As Double, ByVal PageYAtViewCenter As Double, ByVal ZoomFactor As Double)

    Dim dblXPoint As Double

    Dim dblYPoint As Double

    Dim dblZoomFactor As Double



    vsoViewer.GetPageView dblXPoint, dblYPoint, dblZoomFactor



    Debug.Print "New x-coordinate is:"; dblXPoint

    Debug.Print "New y-coordinate is:"; dblYPoint

    Debug.Print "New zoom factor is:"; dblZoomFactor

End Sub
```
