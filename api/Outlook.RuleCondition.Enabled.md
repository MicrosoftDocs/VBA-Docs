# RuleCondition.Enabled property (Outlook)

Returns or sets a **Boolean** that determines if the **[RuleCondition](Outlook.RuleCondition.md)** is enabled. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Enabled**

_expression_ A variable that represents a [RuleCondition](Outlook.RuleCondition.md) object.


## Remarks

After you enable a rule condition, you must also save the rule by using  **[Rules.Save](Outlook.Rules.Save.md)** so that the rule condition and its enabled state will persist beyond the current session. A rule condition is only enabled after it has been saved successfully.

Returns an error if you attempt to enable a rule condition that is supported only on a rule of type  **olRuleSend** for a rule of type **olRuleReceive**, or vice versa. For more information on suppport by rules for receiving messages or rules for sending messages, see [Specify Rule Conditions](../outlook/How-to/Rules/specifying-rule-conditions.md).

You cannot enable or disable a condition of type  **olConditionOtherMachine**. This type of rule condition indicates that the rule can run only on a specific computer that is not the current one. This happens when the rule is created on that computer and the rule condition **olConditionLocalMachineOnly** is enabled, indicating that the rule can run only on that computer. When you run the same rule on another computer, the rule will show that the condition **olConditionOtherMachine** is enabled.

Returns an error if you attempt to enable an exception condition of type  **olConditionLocalMachineOnly**.
