# DropCap object (Word)

Represents a dropped capital letter at the beginning of a paragraph. There is no  **DropCaps** collection; each **[Paragraph](Word.Paragraph.md)** object contains only one **DropCap** object.


## Remarks

Use the **DropCap** property to return a **DropCap** object. The following example sets a dropped capital letter for the first letter in the first paragraph in the active document.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).DropCap 
 .Enable 
 .Position = wdDropNormal 
End With
```
