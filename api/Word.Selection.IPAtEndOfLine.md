# Selection.IPAtEndOfLine property (Word)

 **True** if the insertion point is at the end of a line that wraps to the next line. Read-only **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `IPAtEndOfLine`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[Selection](Word.Selection.md)' object.


## Remarks

 **False** if the selection isn't collapsed, if the insertion point isn't at the end of a line, or if the insertion point is positioned before a paragraph mark.


## Example

If the insertion point isn't already at the end of the line, this example moves it there.


```vb
Selection.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd 
If Selection.IPAtEndOfLine = False Then 
 Selection.EndKey Unit:=wdLine, Extend:=wdMove 
End If
```
