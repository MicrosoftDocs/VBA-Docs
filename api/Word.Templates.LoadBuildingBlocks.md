# Templates.LoadBuildingBlocks method (Word)

Loads the building blocks for all templates into Microsoft Word.


## Syntax

_expression_. `LoadBuildingBlocks`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a '[Templates](Word.templates.md)' object.


## Remarks

Word normally loads building blocks when they are first needed, for example when a user displays a gallery by using the ribbon. This method forces Word to immediately load all building blocks.
