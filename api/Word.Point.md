# Point object (Word)

Represents a single point in a series in a chart.


## Remarks

 The **Point** object is a member of the **[Points](Word.Points.md)** collection. The **Points** collection contains all the points in one series.


## Example

Use  **[Points](Word.Series.Points.md)** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the point index number, to return a single **Point** object. Points are numbered from left to right on the series. `Points(1)` is the leftmost point, and `Points(Points.Count)` is the rightmost point. The following example sets the marker style for the third point in series one for the first chart in the active document. The specified series must be a 2-D line, scatter, or radar series.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1) 
 If .HasChart Then 
 .Chart.SeriesCollection(1).Points(3).MarkerStyle = xlDiamond 
 End If 
End With 

```
