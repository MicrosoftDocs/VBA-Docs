## Example

This example extends the selection down one line.


```vb
Selection.MoveDown Unit:=wdLine, Count:=1, Extend:=wdExtend
```

This example moves the selection down three paragraphs. If the move is successful, "Company" is inserted at the insertion point.




```vb
unitsMoved = Selection.MoveDown(Unit:=wdParagraph, _ 
 Count:=3, Extend:=wdMove) 
If unitsMoved = 3 Then Selection.Text = "Company"
```

This example displays the current line number, moves the selection down three lines, and displays the current line number again.




```vb
MsgBox "Line " & Selection.Information(wdFirstCharacterLineNumber) 
Selection.MoveDown Unit:=wdLine, Count:=3, Extend:=wdMove 
MsgBox "Line " & Selection.Information(wdFirstCharacterLineNumber)
```
