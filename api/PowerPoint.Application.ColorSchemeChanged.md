# Application.ColorSchemeChanged event (PowerPoint)

Occurs after a color scheme is changed.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ColorSchemeChanged`( `_SldRange_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Application](PowerPoint.Application.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _SldRange_|Required|**SlideRange**| The range of slides affected by the change.|

## Remarks

Actions which trigger this event would include actions such as modifying a slide's or slide master's color scheme, or applying a template.

To access the  **Application** events, declare an **Application** variable in the General Declarations section of your code. Then set the variable equal to the **Application** object for which you want to access events. For information about using events with the Microsoft PowerPoint **Application** object, see [How to: Use Events with the Application Object](../powerpoint/How-to/use-events-with-the-application-object.md).


## Example

This example displays a message when the color scheme for the selected slide or slides is changed. This example assumes an **Application** object called PPTApp has been declared by using the **WithEvents** keyword.


```vb
Private Sub PPTApp_ColorSchemeChanged(ByVal SldRange As SlideRange)



    If SldRange.Count = 1 Then

        MsgBox "You've changed the color scheme for " _
            & SldRange.Name & "."

    Else

        MsgBox "You've changed the color scheme for " _
            & SldRange.Count & " slides."

    End If

End Sub
```
