# ShadowFormat.Obscured Property (PowerPoint)

Determines whether the shadow of the specified shape appears filled in and is obscured by the shape. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Obscured`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [ShadowFormat](./PowerPoint.ShadowFormat.md) object.


## Return value

MsoTriState


## Remarks

The value of the  **Obscured** property can be one of these **MsoTriState** constants.



|Constant|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|**msoFalse**|The shadow has no fill and the outline of the shadow is visible through the shape if the shape has no fill.|
|**msoTrue**| The shadow of the specified shape appears filled in and is obscured by the shape, even if the shape has no fill.|

## Example

This example sets the horizontal and vertical offsets of the shadow for shape three on  `myDocument`. The shadow is offset 5 points to the right of the shape and 3 points above it. If the shape doesn't already have a shadow, this example adds one to it. The shadow will be filled in and obscured by the shape, even if the shape has no fill.


```vb
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes(3).Shadow

    .Visible = True

    .OffsetX = 5

    .OffsetY = -3

    .Obscured = msoTrue

End With
```
