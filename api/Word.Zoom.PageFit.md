# Zoom.PageFit property (Word)

Returns or sets the view magnification of a window so that either the entire page is visible or the entire width of the page is visible. Read/write  **WdPageFit**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `PageFit`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Zoom](Word.Zoom.md)' object.


## Remarks

The **wdPageFitFullPage** constant has no effect if the document isn't in print view.

When the **PageFit** property is set to **wdPageFitBestFit**, the zoom percentage is automatically recalculated every time the document window size is changed. Setting this property to **wdPageFitNone** keeps the zoom percentage from being recalculated whenever this happens.


## Example

This example changes the magnification percentage of the window for Letter.doc so that the entire width of the text is visible.


```vb
With Windows("Letter.doc").View 
 .Type = wdNormalView 
 .Zoom.PageFit = wdPageFitBestFit 
End With
```

This example switches the active window to print view and changes the magnification so that the entire page is visible.




```vb
With ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View 
 .Type = wdPrintView 
 .Zoom.PageFit = wdPageFitFullPage 
End With
```
