# Fields.Unlink method (Word)

Replaces all the fields in the **Fields** collection with their most recent results.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Unlink`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Fields](Word.fields.md)' collection.


## Remarks

When you unlink a field, the current result is converted to text or a graphic and can no longer be updated automatically. Note that some fields—such as XE (Index Entry) fields and SEQ (Sequence) fields—cannot be unlinked.


## Example

This example updates and unlinks all the fields in the first section in the active document.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Sections(1).Range.Fields 
 .Update 
 .Unlink 
End With
```
