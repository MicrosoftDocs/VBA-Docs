# Pages Object (Outlook Forms Script)

Represents all the pages of a  **[MultiPage](Outlook.multipage.md)**.


## Remarks

Each  **Pages** collection provides the features to manage the number of pages in the collection and to identify the page that is currently in use.

The default value of the  **Pages** collection identifies the current **Page** of a collection.

You can reference a  **Page** by its index value. The index value reflects the ordinal position of the **Page** within the collection. The index of the first **Page** in a collection is 0; the index of the second **Page** is 1; and so on.
