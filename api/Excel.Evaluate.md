# Evaluate Method

Converts a Microsoft Graph name to an object or a value.

_expression_. `Evaluate( _Name_)`

 _expression_ Required. An expression that returns a Microsoft Graph [Application](Excel.Application-graph-property.md) object.

 **Name** Required **String**. The name of the specified object, using the Microsoft Graph naming convention.

## Remarks

You can use the following types of names in Microsoft Graph with this method:


- A1-style references. You can use any reference to a single cell in A1-style notation. All references are considered to be absolute references.
    
- Ranges. You can use the range, intersect, and union operators (colon, space, and comma, respectively) with references.
    
- Defined names. You can specify any name in the language of the macro.
    

 **Note**  Using square brackets (for example, "[A1:C5]") is identical to calling the  **Evaluate** method with a string argument. For example, the following expressions are equivalent:


```vb
myChart.Application.[a1].Value = 25 
myChart.Application.Evaluate("A1").Value = 25
```

The advantage of using square brackets is that the code is shorter. The advantage of using  **Evaluate** is that the argument is a string, so you can either construct the string in your code or use a Visual Basic variable.


## Example

This example clears cell A1 on the datasheet.


```vb
clearCell = "A1" 
myChart.Application.Evaluate(clearCell).Clear
```
