# Gridlines Object (Excel)

Represents major or minor gridlines on a chart axis.


## Remarks

 Gridlines extend the tick marks on a chart axis to make it easier to see the values associated with the data markers. This object isn't a collection. There's no object that represents a single gridline; you either have all gridlines for an axis turned on or all of them turned off.

Use the  **[MajorGridlines](Excel.Axis.MajorGridlines.md)** property to return the **GridLines** object that represents the major gridlines for the axis. Use the **[MinorGridlines](Excel.Axis.MinorGridlines.md)** property to return the **GridLines** object that represents the minor gridlines. It's possible to return both major and minor gridlines at the same time.


## Example

The following example turns on major gridlines for the category axis on the chart sheet named "Chart1" and then formats the gridlines to be blue dashed lines.


```vb
With Charts("chart1").Axes(xlCategory) 
 .HasMajorGridlines = True 
 .MajorGridlines.Border.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 
 .MajorGridlines.Border.LineStyle = xlDash 
End With
```
