# Report.GotFocus event (Access)

The  **GotFocus** event occurs when the report receives the focus.


## Syntax

_expression_. `GotFocus`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Report](Access.Report.md) object.


## Remarks

To run a macro or event procedure when these events occur, set the  **OnGotFocus** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

These events occur when the focus moves in response to a user action, such as pressing the TAB key or clicking the object, or when you use the  **SetFocus** method in Visual Basic or the SelectObject, GoToRecord, GoToControl, or GoToPage action in a macro.
