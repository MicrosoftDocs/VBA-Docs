# OLEDBConnection.SourceDataFile property (Excel)

Returns or sets a  **String** indicating the source data file for an OLE DB connection. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `SourceDataFile`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [OLEDBConnection](Excel.OLEDBConnection.md) object.


## Remarks

For file-based data sources (for example, Access) the  **SourceDataFile** property contains a fully qualified path to the source data file. It is null for server-based data sources (for example, SQL Server). The **SourceDataFile** property is set to null if the **[Connection](Excel.OLEDBConnection.Connection.md)** property is changed programmatically.
