# ShapeRange.Regroup method (Excel)

Regroups the group that the specified shape range belonged to previously. Returns the regrouped shapes as a single  **[Shape](Excel.Shape.md)** object.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Regroup`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [ShapeRange](./Excel.ShapeRange.md) object.


## Return value

Shape


## Remarks

The  **Regroup** method only restores the group for the first previously grouped shape it finds in the specified **[ShapeRange](Excel.ShapeRange.md)** collection. Therefore, if the specified shape range contains shapes that previously belonged to different groups, only one of the groups will be restored.

Note that because a group of shapes is treated as a single shape, grouping and ungrouping shapes changes the number of items in the  **[Shapes](Excel.Shapes.md)** collection and changes the index numbers of items that come after the affected items in the collection.


## Example

This example regroups the shapes in the selection in the active window. If the shapes haven't been previously grouped and ungrouped, this example will fail.


```vb
ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange.Regroup
```
