# Application.TaskDeliverableCreate method (Project)

Creates or removes a deliverable for the selected task. Available only in Project Professional.


## Syntax

_expression_. `TaskDeliverableCreate`( `_Create_` )

 _expression_ An expression that returns an **[Application](Project.Application.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Create_|Optional|**Variant**|If the selected task has no associated deliverable,  **True** creates a deliverable. If the selected task does have an associated deliverable, **False** removes the deliverable. The default value is **False**.|

## Return value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks

When the selected task does not have a deliverable, following are results of running the **TaskDeliverableCreate** method:


-  `TaskDeliverableCreate(True)` creates a deliverable for the selected task.
    
-  `TaskDeliverableCreate(False)` does nothing.
    


When the selected task has an associated deliverable, following are results of running the **TaskDeliverableCreate** method:


-  `TaskDeliverableCreate(True)` gives the error, **Cannot create a deliverable link for the selected subproject task.**, followed by the run-time error 1004, **An unexpected error occurred with the method.**
    
-  `TaskDeliverableCreate(False)` removes the deliverable.
    


The **TaskDeliverableCreate** method is equivalent to the **Create Deliverables** command on the **Deliverable** drop-down menu on the **Task** tab of the Ribbon. If the selected task has no deliverable, the **Create Deliverables** command creates one. If the selected task has a deliverable, **Create Deliverables** shows an active icon, and selecting the command deletes the deliverable.


> [!NOTE] 
> You cannot create a task deliverable until you publish the project and create a project workspace. You also cannot create a deliverable on a summary task.


## Example

The following example creates or deletes a deliverable for the selected task in a published project.


```vb
Sub ToggleDeliverable() 
    Dim deliverGuid As String 
 
    deliverGuid = ActiveCell.Task.deliverableGuid 
 
    If deliverGuid = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" Then 
        TaskDeliverableCreate Create:=True 
    Else 
        TaskDeliverableCreate Create:=False 
    End If 
End Sub
```
