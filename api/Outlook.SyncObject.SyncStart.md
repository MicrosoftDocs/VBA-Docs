# SyncObject.SyncStart Event (Outlook)

Occurs when Microsoft Outlook begins synchronizing a user's folders using the specified  **Send\Receive** group.


## Syntax

_expression_. `SyncStart`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [SyncObject](./Outlook.SyncObject.md) object.


## Remarks

This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).


## Example

This Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example displays a message telling the user that the synchronization might take a long time. The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the  `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```vb
Dim WithEvents mySync As Outlook.SyncObject 
 
Sub Initialize_handler() 
 Set mySync = Application.Session.SyncObjects.Item(1) 
 mySync.Start 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub mySync_SyncStart() 
 MsgBox "Synchronization is about to start. It might take a long time to complete." 
End Sub
```
