# Bookmark.End property (Word)

Returns or sets the ending character position of a selection, range, or bookmark. Read/write  **Long**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**End**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Bookmark](Word.Bookmark.md)** object.


## Remarks

If this property is set to a value smaller than the **[Start](Word.Bookmark.Start.md)** property, the **Start** property is set to the same value (that is, the **Start** and **End** properties are equal).

This property returns the ending character position relative to the beginning of the story. The main document story (wdMainTextStory) begins with character position 0 (zero). You can change the size of a bookmark by setting this property.


## Example

This example compares the ending position of the "temp" bookmark with the starting position of the "begin" bookmark.


```vb
Set Book1 = ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("begin") 
Set Book2 = ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("temp") 
If Book2.End > Book1.Start Then Book1.Select
```
