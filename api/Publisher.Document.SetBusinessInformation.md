# Document.SetBusinessInformation Method (Publisher)

Applies the specified business information set, which consists of a logo image and business contact information (such as the company name and address), to the current publication.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **SetBusinessInformation**(**_Name_**)

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **Document** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Name|Required| **String**|Name of the business information set to be applied.|

## Remarks

Calling the  **SetBusinessInformation** method corresponds to selecting a business information set (in the **Select a Business Information set** list) and then clicking the **Update Publication** button in the **Business Information** dialog box (**Edit** menu) in the Microsoft Publisher user interface (UI). You must create and edit business information sets in that dialog box before you can use the **SetBusinessInformation** method to apply them programatically.


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **SetBusinessInformation** method to apply a specific business information set to the current publication. Before you run this code, substitute for _BISetName_ the name of a business information set that you have previously created in the Publisher UI.


```vb
Public Sub SetBusinessInformation_Example() 
 
 ThisDocument.SetBusinessInformation "BISetName" 
 
End Sub
```
