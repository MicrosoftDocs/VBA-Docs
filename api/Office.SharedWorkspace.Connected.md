# SharedWorkspace.Connected property (Office)

Gets a  **Boolean** value that indicates whether or not the active document is currently saved in and connected to a shared workspace. Read-only.

> [!NOTE] 
> Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Connected`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [SharedWorkspace](Office.SharedWorkspace.md) object.


## Remarks

Use the  **[Disconnect](Office.SharedWorkspace.Disconnect.md)** method of the **SharedWorkspace** object to disconnect the local copy of the active document from the shared workspace. Use the **[RemoveDocument](Office.SharedWorkspace.RemoveDocument.md)** method to remove the document from the shared workspace.


## Example

```vb
    If ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Connected Then 
        MsgBox "This document is already saved in a shared workspace." 
    End If 

```
