## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Names_|Optional| **Variant**| An array of the names to be applied. If this argument is omitted, all names on the sheet are applied to the range.|
| _IgnoreRelativeAbsolute_|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to replace references with names, regardless of the reference types of either the names or references. **False** to replace absolute references only with absolute names, relative references only with relative names, and mixed references only with mixed names. The default value is **True**.|
| _UseRowColumnNames_|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to use the names of row and column ranges that contain the specified range if names for the range cannot be found. **False** to ignore the _OmitColumn_ and _OmitRow_ arguments. The default value is **True**.|
| _OmitColumn_|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to replace the entire reference with the row-oriented name. The column-oriented name can be omitted only if the referenced cell is in the same column as the formula and is within a row-oriented named range. The default value is **True**.|
| _OmitRow_|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to replace the entire reference with the column-oriented name. The row-oriented name can be omitted only if the referenced cell is in the same row as the formula and is within a column-oriented named range. The default value is **True**.|
| _Order_|Optional| **[xlApplyNamesOrder](Excel.XlApplyNamesOrder.md)**|Determines which range name is listed first when a cell reference is replaced by a row-oriented and column-oriented range name.|
| _AppendLast_|Optional| **Variant**| **True** to replace the definitions of the names in _Names_ and also replace the definitions of the last names that were defined. **False** to replace the definitions of the names in _Names_ only. The default value is **False**.|

## Return value

## Remarks

You can use the  **Array** function to create the list of names for the _Names_ argument.

If you want to apply names to the entire sheet, use  `Cells.ApplyNames`.

You cannot "unapply" names; to delete names, use the  **Delete** method.


## Example

This example applies names to the entire sheet.


```vb
Cells.ApplyNames Names:=Array("Sales", "Profits")
```
