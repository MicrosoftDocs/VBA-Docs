# CustomXMLNode Object (Office)

Represents an XML node in a tree in a document. The  **CustomXMLNode** object is a member of the **CustomXMLNodes** collection.


## Remarks

The  **CustomXMLNode** object is designed to have functional parity with the **IXMLDOMNode** interface. In addition, it contains an **XPath** property, which is a great improvement over the objects provided by MSXML.


## Example

The following example selects a single node from a  **CustomXMLPart** object by using an XPath expression and assigns it to a **CustomXMLNode** object.


```vb
Sub CustomXmlNodes()  
    Dim cxp1 As CustomXMLPart 
    Dim cxn As CustomXMLNode 
 
    With ActiveDocument 
 
        ' Returns the first custom xml part with the given root namespace. 
        Set cxp1 = .CustomXMLParts("urn:invoice:namespace")  
         
        ' Get the first node matching the XPath expression.                              
        Set cxn = cxp1.SelectSingleNode("//*[@quantity < 4]") 
                 
    End With 
     
End Sub
```
