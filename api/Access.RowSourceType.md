# RowSourceType Property (User-Defined Function) - Code Argument Values

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The Visual Basic function you create must accept five arguments. The first argument must be declared as a control and the remaining arguments as **Variants**. The function itself must return a **Variant**.

**Function** _functionname_ (**_fld_ As Control**, **_id_ As Variant**, **_row_ As Variant**, **_col_ As Variant**, **_code_ As Variant**) As Variant

The **Function** procedure has the following five required arguments.


|**Argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _fld_|A control variable that refers to the list box or combo box being filled.|
| _id_|A unique value that identifies the control being filled. This is useful when you want to use the same user-defined function for more than one list box or combo box and must distinguish between them. (The example sets this variable to the value of the **Timer** function.)|
| _row_|The row being filled (zero-based).|
| _col_|The column being filled (zero-based).|
| _code_|An intrinsic constant that specifies the kind of information being requested.|

> [!NOTE] 
> Because Microsoft Access calls a user-defined function several times to insert items into a list, often you must preserve information from call to call. The best way to do this is to use Static variables.

Microsoft Access calls the user-defined function by repeatedly using different values in the  _code_ argument to specify the information it needs. The _code_ argument can use the following intrinsic constants.


|**Constant**|**Meaning**|**Function returns**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**acLBInitialize**|Initialize|Nonzero if the function can fill the list; **False** (0) or **Null** otherwise.|
|**acLBOpen**|Open|Nonzero ID value if the function can fill the list; **False** or **Null** otherwise.|
|**acLBGetRowCount**|Number of rows|Number of rows in the list (can be zero); -1 if unknown.|
|**acLBGetColumnCount**|Number of columns|Number of columns in the list (can't be zero); must match the property sheet value.|
|**acLBGetColumnWidth**|Column width|Width (in twips) of the column specified by the  _col_ argument; -1 to use the default width.|
|**acLBGetValue**|List entry|List entry to be displayed in the row and column specified by the  _row_ and _col_ arguments.|
|**acLBGetFormat**|Format string|Format string to be used to format the list entry displayed in the row and column specified by the  _row_ and _col_ arguments; -1 to use the default format.|
|**acLBEnd**|End (the last call to a user-defined function always uses this value)|Nothing.|
|**acLBClose**|(Not used)|Not used.|

Microsoft Access calls your user-defined function once for **acLBInitialize**, **acLBOpen**, **acLBGetRowCount**, and **acLBGetColumnCount**. It initializes the user-defined function, opens the query, and determines the number of rows and columns.

Microsoft Access calls your user-defined function twice for **acLBGetColumnWidth** â€” once to determine the total width of the list box or combo box and a second time to set the column width.

The number of times your user-defined function is called for **acLBGetValue** and **acLBGetFormat** to get list entries and to format strings varies depending on the number of entries, the user's scrolling, and other factors.
Microsoft Access calls the user-defined function for **acLBEnd** when the form is closed or each time the list box or combo box is queried.

Whenever a particular value (such as the number of columns) is required, returning **Null** or any invalid value causes Microsoft Access to stop calling the user-defined function with that code.

> [!TIP] 
> You can use the Select Case code structure from the example as a template for your own **RowSourceType** property user-defined functions.


## Example

The following user-defined function returns a list of the next four Mondays following today's date. To call this function from a list box control, enter **ListMondays** as the **RowSourceType** property setting and leave the **RowSource** property setting blank.


```vb
Function ListMondays(fld As Control,id As Variant, _ 
 row As Variant,col As Variant,code As Variant) _ 
 As Variant 
 Dim intOffset As Integer 
 Select Case code 
 Case acLBInitialize ' Initialize. 
 ListMondays = True 
 Case acLBOpen ' Open. 
 ListMondays = Timer ' Unique ID. 
 Case acLBGetRowCount ' Get rows. 
 ListMondays = 4 
 Case acLBGetColumnCount ' Get columns. 
 ListMondays = 1 
 Case acLBGetColumnWidth ' Get column width. 
 ListMondays = -1 ' Use default width. 
 Case acLBGetValue ' Get the data. 
 intOffset = Abs((9 - Weekday(Now))Mod 7) 
 ListMondays = Format(Now() + _ 
 intOffset + 7 * row,"mmmm d") 
 End Select 
End Function
```

The next example uses a static array to store the names of the databases in the current directory. To call this function, enter **ListMDBs** as the **RowSourceType** property setting and leave the **RowSource** property setting blank.




```vb
Function ListMDBs(fld As Control, id As Variant, _ 
 row As Variant, col As Variant, _ 
 code As Variant) As Variant 
 Static dbs(127) As String, Entries As Integer 
 Dim ReturnVal As Variant 
 ReturnVal = Null 
 Select Case code 
 Case acLBInitialize ' Initialize. 
 Entries = 0 
 dbs(Entries ) = Dir("*.MDB") 
 Do Until dbs(Entries) = "" Or Entries >= 127 
 Entries = Entries+1 
 dbs(Entries) = Dir 
 Loop 
 ReturnVal = Entries 
 Case acLBOpen ' Open. 
 ' Generate unique ID for control. 
 ReturnVal = Timer 
 Case acLBGetRowCount ' Get number of rows. 
 ReturnVal = Entries 
 Case acLBGetColumnCount ' Get number of columns. 
 ReturnVal = 1 
 Case acLBGetColumnWidth ' Column width. 
 ' -1 forces use of default width. 
 ReturnVal = -1 
 Case acLBGetValue ' Get data. 
 ReturnVal = dbs(row) 
 Case acLBEnd ' End. 
 Erase dbs 
 End Select 
 ListMDBs = ReturnVal 
End Function
```
