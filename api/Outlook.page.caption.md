# Page.Caption Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a  **String** that specifies the text that appears on the page. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Caption**

_expression_ A variable that represents a  **Page** object.


## Remarks

The default caption for an object is a unique name based on the type of object. For example, CommandButton1 is the default caption for the first command button in a form.

If an object's caption is too long, the caption is truncated. If a form's caption is too long for the title bar, the title is displayed with an ellipsis.
