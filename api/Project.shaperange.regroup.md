# ShapeRange.Regroup Method (Project)
The  **Regroup** method is not implemented in Project.

## Syntax

 _expression_. `Regroup`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a 'ShapeRange' object.


## Return value

 **Shape**


## Remarks

In general for applications that implement Office Art, the  **Regroup** method recreates the group that the shape range previously belonged to, and returns the grouped shapes as a single **Shape** object. Project does not support automatic grouping of shapes in a report.
