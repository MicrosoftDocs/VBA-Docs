Sub PlaceProjectInLowerScreenHalf() 
 
 Dim WindowWidth As Double 
 
 Application.WindowState = pjMaximized

 Application.Height = Application.Height / 2 
 Application.Top = Application.Height 
 
 'Ensure that the window uses all the available width. 
 If Application.Width < WindowWidth Then 
 Application.Width = WindowWidth 
 Application.Left = 0 
 End If 
 
End Sub
