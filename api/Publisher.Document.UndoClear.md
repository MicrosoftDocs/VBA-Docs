# Document.UndoClear Method (Publisher)

Clears the list of actions that can be undone for the specified publication. Corresponds to the list of items that appears when you click the arrow beside the  **Undo** button on the **Standard** toolbar.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **UndoClear**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **Document** object.


## Remarks

```vb
ActiveDocument.UndoClear
```
