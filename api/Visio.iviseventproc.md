# IVisEventProc object (Visio)

The interface for handling event notifications in Microsoft Visio. 


## Remarks

In addition to the methods inherited from **IDispatch**, the **IVisEventProc** interface contains a single function, **VisEventProc**, which returns a **Variant**. Because **IVisEventProc** inherits from **IDispatch** and hence from **IUnknown**, you must implement the methods in those interfaces as well as the **VisEventProc** method.

To handle event notifications in Visio, create a class module that implements the **IVisEventProc** interface in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or Microsoft Visual Basic, and then create an instance of this class to pass as an argument to the **[AddAdvise](Visio.EventList.AddAdvise.md)** method of the **EventList** collection.


## Methods

- [VisEventProc](Visio.IVisEventProc.VisEventProc.md)
