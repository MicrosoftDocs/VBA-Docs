# PublishObject object (Excel)

Represents an item in a workbook that has been saved to a Web page and can be refreshed according to values specified by the properties and methods of the  **PublishObject** object.


## Remarks

 The **PublishObject** object is a member of the **[PublishObjects](Excel.PublishObjects.md)** collection.


## Example

Use  **[PublishObjects](Excel.Workbook.PublishObjects.md)** ( _index_ ), where _index_ is the index number of the specified item in the workbook, to return a single **PublishObject** object. The following example sets the location where the first item in workbook three is saved.


```vb
Workbooks(3).PublishObjects(1).FileName = _ 
 "\\myserver\public\finacct\statemnt.htm"
```
