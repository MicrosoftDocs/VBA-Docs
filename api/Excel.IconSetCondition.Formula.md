# IconSetCondition.Formula Property (Excel)

Returns or sets a  **String** representing a formula, which determines the values to which the icon set will be applied.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Formula`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [IconSetCondition](Excel.IconSetCondition.md) object.


## Remarks

This property is useful to limit the range of values that will display the conditional format. A typical scenario is when you have a range of numbers containing both positive and negative values. You may want to create more than one conditional format for this range of numbersâ€”one for positive values and another for negative values.
