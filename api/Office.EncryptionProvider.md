# EncryptionProvider object (Office)

Provides the methods for setting up permissions, applying the cryptography of the underlying encryption and decryption, and user authentication. 


## Remarks

Encryption providers are implemented through custom COM add-ins. You are provided with storage within Office documents for add-in specific information to store whatever information you need to encrypt, decrypt, apply rights, and display permission setup or authentication user interfaces.
