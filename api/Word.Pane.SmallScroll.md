## Syntax

## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Down_|Optional| **Variant**|The number of lines to scroll the window down. A "line" corresponds to the distance scrolled by clicking the down scroll arrow on the vertical scroll bar once.|
| _Up_|Optional| **Variant**|The number of lines to scroll the window up. A "line" corresponds to the distance scrolled by clicking the up scroll arrow on the vertical scroll bar once.|
| _ToRight_|Optional| **Variant**|The number of lines to scroll the window to the right. A "line" corresponds to the distance scrolled by clicking the right scroll arrow on the horizontal scroll bar once.|
| _ToLeft_|Optional| **Variant**|The number of lines to scroll the window to the left. A "line" corresponds to the distance scrolled by clicking the left scroll arrow on the horizontal scroll bar once.|

## Remarks

This method is equivalent to clicking the scroll arrows on the horizontal and vertical scroll bars.

If Down and Up are both specified, the window is scrolled by the difference of the arguments. For example, if Down is 3 and Up is 6, the window is scrolled up three lines. Similarly, if ToLeft and ToRight are both specified, the window is scrolled by the difference of the arguments.

Any of these arguments can be a negative number. If no arguments are specified, the window is scrolled down by one line.
