# CustomTaskPane.Delete Method (Office)

Deletes the active custom task pane.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Delete`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [CustomTaskPane](./Office.CustomTaskPane.md) object.


## Example

The following example, written in C#, creates an instance of a  **CustomTaskPane** object and implements its only method, **CTPFactoryAvailable**. **CTPFactoryAvailable** passes a **CTPFactory** object to the add-in, that can be used during the add-in's lifetime to create task panes by using the **CreateCTP** method. The project also implements a button that is used to delete the active task pane. Note that the example assumes that the task pane is part of an COM add-in and thus implements **Extensibility.IDTExtensibility2**. The add-in also refers to a Microsoft ActiveX速 control, SampleActiveX.myControl, that was created in a separate project.


```vb
public class Connect : Object, Extensibility.IDTExtensibility2, ICustomTaskPaneConsumer 
... 
object missing = Type.Missing; 
public CustomTaskPane CTP = null; 
 
public void CTPFactoryAvailable(ICTPFactory CTPFactoryInst) 
{ 
 CTP = CTPFactoryInst.CreateCTP("SampleActiveX.myControl", "Task Pane Example", missing); 
 sampleAX = (myControl)CTP.ContentControl; 
 sampleAX.InsertTextClicked += new InsertTextEventHandler(sampleAX_InsertTextClicked); 
 CTP.Visible = true; 
} 
... 

```

> [!NOTE] 
> You can create custom task panes in any language that supports COM and allows you to create dynamic-linked library (DLL) files. For example, Microsoft Visual Basic速 6.0, Microsoft Visual Basic .NET, Microsoft Visual C++速, Microsoft Visual C++ .NET, and Microsoft Visual C#速. However, Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) does not support creating custom task panes.
