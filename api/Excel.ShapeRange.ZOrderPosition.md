# ShapeRange.ZOrderPosition property (Excel)

Returns the position of the specified shape in the z-order. Read-only  **Long**.Read-only


## Syntax

_expression_. `ZOrderPosition`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [ShapeRange](./Excel.ShapeRange.md) object.


## Remarks

To set the shape's position in the z-order, use the  **[ZOrder](Excel.ShapeRange.ZOrder.md)** method.

A shape's position in the z-order corresponds to the shape's index number in the  **Shapes** collection. For example, if there are four shapes on `myDocument`, the expression  `myDocument.Shapes(1)` returns the shape at the back of the z-order, and the expression `myDocument.Shapes(4)` returns the shape at the front of the z-order.

Whenever you add a new shape to a collection, it's added to the front of the z-order by default.


## Example

This example adds an oval to  `myDocument` and then places the oval second from the back in the z-order if there is at least one other shape on the document.


```vb
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeOval, 100, 100, 100, 300) 
 While .ZOrderPosition > 2 
 .ZOrder msoSendBackward 
 Wend 
End With
```
