# Selection.FillStyleKeepFmt Property (Visio)

Applies a fill style to an object while preserving local formatting. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `FillStyleKeepFmt`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Selection](./Visio.Selection.md) object.


### Return value

String


## Remarks

Setting a style to a nonexistent style generates an error. Setting one type of style to another type (for example, setting the  **FillStyleKeepFmt** property to a line style) does nothing. Setting one type of style to another type that has more than one set of attributes changes only the appropriate attributes (for example, setting the **FillStyleKeepFmt** property to a style that has line, text, and fill attributes changes only the fill attributes).

Beginning with Microsoft Visio 2002, setting  **FillStyleKeepFmt** to an empty string ("") causes the master's style to be reapplied to the selection or shape. (Earlier versions generate a "no such style" exception.) If the selection or shape has no master, its style remains unchanged.
