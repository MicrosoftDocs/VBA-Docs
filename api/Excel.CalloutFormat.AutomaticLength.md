# CalloutFormat.AutomaticLength method (Excel)

Specifies that the first segment of the callout line (the segment attached to the text callout box) be scaled automatically when the callout is moved. Use the  **[CustomLength](Excel.CalloutFormat.CustomLength.md)** method to specify that the first segment of the callout line retain the fixed length returned by the **[Length](Excel.CalloutFormat.Length.md)** property whenever the callout is moved. Applies only to callouts whose lines consist of more than one segment (types **msoCalloutThree** and **msoCalloutFour**).


## Syntax

_expression_. `AutomaticLength`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [CalloutFormat](Excel.CalloutFormat.md) object.


## Remarks

Applying this method sets the  **[AutoLength](Excel.CalloutFormat.AutoLength.md)** property to **True**.


## Example

This example toggles between an automatically scaling first segment and one with a fixed length for the callout line for shape one on  `myDocument`. For the example to work, shape one must be a callout.


```vb
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes(1).Callout 
 If .AutoLength Then 
 .CustomLength 50 
 Else 
 .AutomaticLength 
 End If 
End With
```
