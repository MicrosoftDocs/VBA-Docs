Used without an object qualifier, this property returns an  **[Application](Publisher.Application.md)** object that represents the current instance of Publisher. Used with an object qualifier, this property returns an  **Application** object that represents the creator of the specified object. When used with an OLE Automation object, it returns the object's application.


## Syntax

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **Documents** object.


## Example

 MsgBox "Current Publisher: version " _ 
 & .Version & " build " & .Build 
End With
```

Dim shpOle As Shape 
 
For Each shpOle In ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes 
 If shpOle.Type = pbLinkedOLEObject Then 
 MsgBox shpOle.OLEFormat.Application.Name 
 End If 
Next
