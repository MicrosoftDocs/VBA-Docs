# Application.Hinstance Property (Excel)

Returns a handle to the instance of Excel represented by the [Application](Excel.Application(object).md) object. Read-only **Long** .


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Hinstance`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application(Graph property).md) object.


## Remarks


 **Important**  This property returns a correct handle only in the 32-bit version of Excel. In Excel, the [HinstancePtr](Excel.Application.HinstancePtr.md) property was introduced, which works correctly in both 32- and 64-bit versions of Excel.

```vb
Sub CheckHinstance() 
 
 MsgBox Application.Hinstance 
 
End Sub
```
