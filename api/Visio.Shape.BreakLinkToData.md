# Shape.BreakLinkToData Method (Visio)

Breaks the link between the shape and the data row to which it is linked in the specified data recordset.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `BreakLinkToData`( `_DataRecordsetID_` )

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [Shape](./Visio.Shape.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _DataRecordsetID_|Required| **Long**|The ID of the data recordset containing the data row the shape is linked to.|

## Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

Breaking the link between an shape and a data row does not remove shape data (called custom properties in some previous versions of Visio) from the shape, nor does it remove any data graphics associated with the shape.


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **BreakLinkToData** method to break the link between a shape and a data row in a data recordset.

Before running this macro, place a shape on the page, add at least one data recordset to the  **[DataRecordsets](Visio.DataRecordsets.md)** collection of the document, and use any linking method to link the shape to a data row in the data recordset you most recently added to the collection. Alternatively, you could link the shape to a data row by dragging the row from the **External Data** window onto the shape in the Visio user interface. Then select the linked shape.




```vb
Public Sub BreakLinkToData_Example() 
 
    Dim vsoDataRecordset As Visio.DataRecordset 
    Dim vsoShape As Visio.Shape 
    Dim intCount As Integer 
         
    intCount = Visio.ActiveDocument.DataRecordsets.Count 
    Set vsoDataRecordset = Visio.ActiveDocument.DataRecordsets(intCount) 
     
    Set vsoShape = ActiveWindow.Selection.PrimaryItem 
    vsoShape.BreakLinkToData (vsoDataRecordset.ID) 
    
End Sub
```
