# DataConnection.ConnectionString Property (Visio)

Gets or sets the connection string that you can use to access an existing  **[DataConnection](Visio.DataConnection.md)** object or to create a new **DataConnection** object. Read/write.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ConnectionString`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [DataConnection](./Visio.DataConnection.md) object.


### Return value

String


## Remarks

The value of the  **ConnectionString** property for a given **DataRecordset** object is the same string that you would pass to the **[DataRecordsets.Add](Visio.DataRecordsets.Add.md)** method to create the data recordset.

The easiest way to determine an appropriate connection string for a particular data source is to use the  **Data Selector Wizard** in the Visio user interface (UI) to make the same connection, recording a macro while running the wizard, and then copying the connection string from the macro code.

Setting the  **ConnectionString** property to a new value has no effect on data already in any data recordsets. To update the data in a data recordset using a new **ConnectionString** setting, call the **[DataRecordset.Refresh](Visio.DataRecordset.Refresh.md)** method.
