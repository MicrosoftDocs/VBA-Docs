# Application.CalculateFullRebuild method (Excel)

For all open workbooks, forces a full calculation of the data and rebuilds the dependencies.


## Syntax

_expression_. `CalculateFullRebuild`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application-graph-property.md) object.


## Remarks

Dependencies are the formulas that depend on other cells. For example, the formula "=A1" depends on cell A1. The  **CalculateFullRebuild** method is similar to re-entering all formulas.


## Example

This example compares the version of Microsoft Excel with the version of Excel in which the workbook was last calculated. If the two version numbers are different, a full calculation of the data in all open workbooks is performed and the dependencies are rebuilt.


```vb
Sub UseCalculateFullRebuild() 
 
 If Application.CalculationVersion <> _ 
 Workbooks(1).CalculationVersion Then 
 Application.CalculateFullRebuild 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
