# PlotArea.InsideHeight property (Excel)

Returns the inside height of the plot area, in points. Read-write  **Double**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `InsideHeight`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [PlotArea](Excel.PlotArea-graph-property.md) object.

With Charts("chart1") 
 Set pa = .PlotArea 
 With .Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, _ 
 pa.InsideLeft, pa.InsideTop, _ 
 pa.InsideWidth, pa.InsideHeight) 
 .Fill.Transparency = 1 
 .Line.DashStyle = msoLineDashDot 
 End With 
End With
```
