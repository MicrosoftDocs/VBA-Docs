# Permission.DocumentAuthor Property (Office)

Gets or sets the name in e-mail form of the author of the active document. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `DocumentAuthor`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Permission](./Office.Permission.md) object.


## Remarks

The  **DocumentAuthor** property returns or sets the author of the active document. The author always has non-expiring owner rights to the document, whether owner permission is granted explicitly (through a **[UserPermission](userOffice.Permission.md)** object) or not.

The  **DocumentAuthor** property can only be changed to a different account that has been certified through the permissions user interface to open restricted content on the local computer. In most cases, users who have a single Windows account can only choose between their Windows and their Passport identities.

If the user's Microsoft Windows and Passport identities use the same e-mail address, then use the format  `passport:someone@example.com` to specify the Passport identity as the **DocumentAuthor** property.


## Example

The following example displays information about the permissions settings of the active document, including the document author.


```vb
 Dim irmPermission As Office.Permission 
 Dim strIRMInfo As String 
 Set irmPermission = ActiveWorkbook.Permission 
 If irmPermission.Enabled Then 
 strIRMInfo = "Permissions are enabled on this document." &amp; vbCrLf 
 strIRMInfo = strIRMInfo &amp; " View in trusted browser: " &amp; _ 
 irmPermission.EnableTrustedBrowser &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
 " Document author: " &amp; irmPermission.DocumentAuthor &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
 " Users with rights: " &amp; irmPermission.Count &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
 " Cache licenses locally: " &amp; irmPermission.StoreLicenses &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
 " Request permission URL: " &amp; irmPermission.RequestPermissionURL &amp; vbCrLf 
 If irmPermission.PermissionFromPolicy Then 
 strIRMInfo = strIRMInfo &amp; " Permissions applied from policy:" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
 " Policy name: " &amp; irmPermission.PolicyName &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _ 
 " Policy description: " &amp; irmPermission.PolicyDescription 
 Else 
 strIRMInfo = strIRMInfo &amp; " Default permissions applied." 
 End If 
 Else 
 strIRMInfo = "Permissions are NOT enabled on this document." 
 End If 
 MsgBox strIRMInfo, vbInformation + vbOKOnly, "IRM Information" 
 Set irmPermission = Nothing 

```
