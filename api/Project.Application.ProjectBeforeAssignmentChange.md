# Application.ProjectBeforeAssignmentChange event (Project)

Occurs before the user changes the value of an assignment field.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ProjectBeforeAssignmentChange`( `_asg_`, `_Field_`, `_NewVal_`, `_Cancel_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Application](Project.Application.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _asg_|Required|**Assignment**|The assignment whose field is being changed.|
| _Field_|Required|**PjAssignmentField**| The field being changed. If more than one field is changed by the user, the event is triggered for each field changed. Can be one of the following **[PjAssignmentField](Project.PjAssignmentField.md)** constants.|
| _NewVal_|Required|**Variant**|The new value for the field specified with  **Field**.|
| _Cancel_|Required|**Boolean**|**False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, the value for the field specified with **Field** is not changed.|

## Remarks

Project events do not occur when the project is embedded in another document or application.

The **ProjectBeforeAssignmentChange** event doesn't occur when timescaled data changes, when an entire resource or task row is pasted, when an assignment is changed as the result of a drag-and-drop operation in the Resource Usage view, during resource pool operations, when inserting or removing a subproject, or when changes have been made using a custom form. For more information and sample code for creating and testing an event handler, see [Using Events with Application and Project Objects](../project/Concepts/using-events-with-application-and-project-objects.md).


## Example

The following example examines new resource assignments and cancels them if they are for the specified resource. This example requires a new class module and additional code for it to have an effect.


```vb
Private Sub App_ProjectBeforeAssignmentChange(ByVal asg As Assignment, ByVal Field As PjAssignmentField, _ 
    ByVal NewVal As Variant, Cancel As Boolean) 
 
    If Field = pjAssignmentResourceName And NewVal = "Lisa Jones" Then 
        MsgBox "Lisa is no longer available for assignment!" 
        Cancel = True 
    End If 
End Sub
```
