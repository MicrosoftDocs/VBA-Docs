# Task.WBSPredecessors Property (Project)

Gets the work breakdown structure (WBS) codes of the task predecessors, separated by the list separator. Read-only  **String**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `WBSPredecessors`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Task](./Project.Task.md) object.


## Example

The following example queries the user for a task ID and then provides a more user-friendly breakdown of its predecessors' WBS codes.


```vb
Sub EnumeratePredecessors() 
 Dim Task As Task 
 Dim PredTasks As Tasks 
 Dim ID As Long 
 Dim Predecessors As String 
 Dim List As String 
 Dim Count As Integer 
 
 ID = CLng(InputBox$("Enter the ID number of the task you wish to examine:")) 
 
 Set Task = ActiveProject.Tasks(ID) 
 Set PredTasks = Task.PredecessorTasks 
 Predecessors = Task.WBSPredecessors 
 Count = 1 
 
 If PredTasks.Count = 0 Then 
 List = "Task " & Task.UniqueID & ", " & Task.Name & ", has no predecessors." 
 Else 
 List = "Predecessors to task " & Task.UniqueID & ", " & Task.Name & ":" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf 
 Do While InStr(Predecessors, ListSeparator) <> 0 
 List = List & PredTasks(Count).Name & ": " & Mid$(Predecessors, 1, InStr(Predecessors, ListSeparator) - 1) & vbCrLf 
 Predecessors = Right$(Predecessors, Len(Predecessors) - InStr(Predecessors, ListSeparator)) 
 Count = Count + 1 
 Loop 
 List = List & PredTasks(Count).Name & ": " & Predecessors 
 End If 
 
 MsgBox List 
 
 Set PredTasks = Nothing 
 Set Task = Nothing 
End Sub
```
