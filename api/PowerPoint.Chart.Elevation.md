# Chart.Elevation Property (PowerPoint)

Returns or sets the elevation, in degrees, of the 3-D chart view. Read/write  **Long**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Elevation`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[Chart](PowerPoint.Chart.md)' object.


## Remarks

The chart elevation is the height, in degrees, at which you view the chart. The default is 15 for most chart types. The value of this property must be between -90 and 90, except for 3-D bar charts, where it must be between 0 and 44.


 **Note**  This property applies only to 3-D charts.


## Example




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

The following example sets the chart elevation of the first chart in the active document to 34 degrees. You should run the example on a 3-D chart.




```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        .Chart.Elevation = 34

    End If

End With
```
