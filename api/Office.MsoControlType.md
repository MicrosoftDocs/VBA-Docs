# MsoControlType enumeration (Office)

Specifies the type of the command bar control. Used with the  **Add** method of the **CommandBarControls** object. Only a limited set of the control types can be created via the **CommandBars** object model: **msoControlButton**, **msoControlEdit**, **msoControlDropdown**, **msoControlComboBox**, **msoControlPopup**, and **msoControlActiveX**. Other control types may exist on built-in or add-in command bars, but cannot be created via the object model.
