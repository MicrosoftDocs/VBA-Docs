# Shapes.AddPolyline Method (Publisher)

Adds a new  **Shape** object representing an open polyline or a closed polygon to the specified **Shapes** collection.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AddPolyline**(**_SafeArrayOfPoints_**)

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **Shapes** object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|SafeArrayOfPoints|Required| **Variant**|An array of coordinate pairs that specifies the polyline's or polygon's vertices.|

### Return value

Shape


## Remarks

For the array elements in  **_SafeArrayOfPoints_**, numeric values are evaluated in points; strings can be in any units supported by Microsoft Publisher (for example, "2.5 in").

To form a closed polygon, assign the same coordinates to the first and last vertices in the polyline drawing.


## Example

The following example adds a triangle to the first page of the active publication. Because the first and last points have the same coordinates, the polygon is closed.


```vb
Dim shpPolyline As Shape 
Dim arrPoints(1 To 4, 1 To 2) As Single 
 
arrPoints(1, 1) = 25 
arrPoints(1, 2) = 100 
arrPoints(2, 1) = 100 
arrPoints(2, 2) = 150 
arrPoints(3, 1) = 150 
arrPoints(3, 2) = 50 
arrPoints(4, 1) = 25 
arrPoints(4, 2) = 100 
 
Set shpPolyline = ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes.AddPolyline _ 
 (SafeArrayOfPoints:=arrPoints)
```
