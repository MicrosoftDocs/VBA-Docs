# Application.Keyboard method (Word)

Returns or sets the keyboard language and layout settings.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Keyboard`( `_LangId_` )

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents an '[Application](Word.Application.md)' object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _LangId_|Optional| **Long**|The language and layout combination to which Microsoft Word sets the keyboard. If this argument is omitted, the method returns the current language and layout setting.|

## Remarks

Microsoft Windows tracks keyboard language and layout settings using a variable type called an input language handle, often referred to as an HKL. The low word of the handle is a language ID, and the high word is a handle to a keyboard layout.


## Example

This example assigns the current keyboard language and layout setting to a variable.


```vb
Dim lngKeyboard As Long 
 
lng
```


```vb
Keyboard = Application.Keyboard
```
