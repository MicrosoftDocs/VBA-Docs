# Language object (Word)

Represents a language used for proofing or formatting in Microsoft Word. The **Language** object is a member of the **Languages** collection.


## Remarks

Use  **Languages** (Index) to return a single **Language** object, where Index can be the value of the **Name** property, the value of the **NameLocal** property, one of the **WdLanguageID** constants, or one of the **MsoLanguageID** constants. (For the list of valid **WdLanguageID** or **MsoLanguageID** constants, see the Object Browser in the Visual Basic Editor.)

The **Name** property returns the name of a language, whereas the **NameLocal** property returns the name of a language in the language of the user. The following example returns the string "Italiano" for **Name** and "Italian (Standard)" for **NameLocal** when it is run in the U.S. English version of Word.




```vb
Sub ShowItalianNames() 
 Msgbox Languages(wdItalian).Name 
 Msgbox Languages(wdItalian).NameLocal 
End Sub
```

For each language for which proofing tools are installed, you can use the **ActiveGrammarDictionary**, **ActiveHyphenationDictionary**, **ActiveSpellingDictionary**, and **ActiveThesaurusDictionary** properties to return the corresponding **Dictionary** object. The following example returns the full path for the active spelling dictionary used in the U.S. English version of Word.




```vb
Sub ShowDictionaryPath 
 Set myspell = Languages(wdEnglishUS).ActiveSpellingDictionary 
 MsgBox mySpell.Path & Application.PathSeparator & mySpell.Name 
End Sub
```

The writing style is the set of rules used by the grammar checker. The **WritingStyleList** property returns an array of strings that represent the available writing styles for the specified language. The following example returns the list of writing styles for U.S. English.




```vb
Sub ListWritingStyles() 
 WrStyles = Languages(wdEnglishUS).WritingStyleList 
 For i = 1 To UBound(WrStyles) 
 MsgBox WrStyles(i) 
 Next i 
End Sub
```

Use the **DefaultWritingStyle** property to set the default writing style you want Word to use.




```vb
Languages(wdEnglishUS).DefaultWritingStyle = "Casual"
```

You can override the default writing style with the **ActiveWritingStyle** property. This property is applied to a specified document for text marked in a specified language. The following example sets the writing style to be used for checking U.S. English, French, and German in the active document.




```vb
Sub SetWritingStyle() 
 With ActiveDocument 
 .ActiveWritingStyle(wdEnglishUS) = "Technical" 
 .ActiveWritingStyle(wdFrench) = "Commercial" 
 .ActiveWritingStyle(wdGerman) = "Technisch/Wiss" 
 End With 
End Sub
```

If you mark text as  **wdNoProofing**, Word skips the marked text when running a spelling or grammar check.


> [!NOTE] 
> You must have the proofing tools installed for each language you intend to check. For more information on working in other languages, see [Language-specific information](overview/Word.md).
