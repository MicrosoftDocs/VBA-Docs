## Syntax

 _expression_. `HasHiLoLines`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[ChartGroup](Word.ChartGroup.md)' object.

 If .HasChart Then 
 With .Chart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasHiLoLines = True 
 With .HiLoLines.Border 
 .LineStyle = xlThin 
 .Weight = xlMedium 
 .ColorIndex = 3 
 End With 
 End With 
 End If 
End With
