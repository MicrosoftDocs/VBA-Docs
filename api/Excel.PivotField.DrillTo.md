# PivotField.DrillTo method (Excel)

The  **DrillTo** method supports drilling to a specified PivotField from another PivotField.


## Syntax

_expression_. `DrillTo`( `_PivotFieldName_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [PivotField](Excel.PivotField.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _PivotFieldName_|Required| **String**|The name of the  **PivotField** to drill to.|

## Remarks

This operation can only be performed on fields that are actually on the PivotTable. So either a hierarchy containing the requested PivotField has to be in rows or columns of the PivotTable, or the attribute/relational field has to be in rows or columns of the PivotTable placed next to at least one other attribute/relational field. Also, the field being drilled to has to be in the same hierarchy or attribute chain. If these conditions are not met, a run-time error occurs.
