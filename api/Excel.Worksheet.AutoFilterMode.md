# Worksheet.AutoFilterMode property (Excel)

 **True** if the AutoFilter drop-down arrows are currently displayed on the sheet. This property is independent of the **FilterMode** property. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AutoFilterMode`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Worksheet](./Excel.Worksheet.md) object.


## Remarks

This property returns  **True** if the drop-down arrows are currently displayed. You can set this property to **False** to remove the arrows, but you cannot set it to **True**. Use the **[AutoFilter](Excel.Worksheet.AutoFilter.md)** method to filter a list and display the drop-down arrows.


## Example

This example displays the current status of the  **AutoFilterMode** property on Sheet1.


```vb
If Worksheets("Sheet1").AutoFilterMode Then 
 isOn = "On" 
Else 
 isOn = "Off" 
End If 
MsgBox "AutoFilterMode is " & isOn
```
