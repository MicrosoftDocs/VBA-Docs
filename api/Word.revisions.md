# Revisions object (Word)

A collection of  **[Revision](Word.Revision.md)** objects that represent the changes marked with revision marks in a range or document.


## Remarks

Use the **Revisions** property to return the **Revisions** collection. The following code example displays the number of revisions in the main text story.


```vb
MsgBox ActiveDocument.Revisions.Count
```

The following code example accepts all the revisions in the selection.




```vb
For Each myRev In Selection.Range.Revisions 
 myRev.Accept 
Next myRev
```

The following code example accepts all the revisions in the first paragraph in the selection.




```vb
Set myRange = Selection.Paragraphs(1).Range 
myRange.Revisions.AcceptAll
```

The **Add** method is not available for the **Revisions** collection. **Revision** objects are added when change tracking is enabled. Set the **TrackRevisions** property to **True** to track revisions made to the document text. The following code example enables revision tracking in the active document and then inserts "The " before the selection.




```vb
ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions = True 
Selection.InsertBefore "The "
```

Use  **Revisions** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **Revision** object. The index number represents the position of the revision in the range or document. The following code example displays the author name for the first revision in the first section.




```vb
MsgBox ActiveDocument.Sections(1).Range.Revisions(1).Author
```

The **Count** property for this collection in a document returns the number of items in the main story only. To count items in other stories use the collection with the **Range** object.
