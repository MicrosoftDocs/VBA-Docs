# Shape.TopRelative property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the relative top position of a shape. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `TopRelative`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **[Shape](Word.Shape.md)** object.


## Remarks

Use this property with the **[RelativeHorizontalPosition](Word.Shape.RelativeHorizontalPosition.md)** property. When set to **wdShapePositionRelativeNone** (-999999) (see the **[WdShapePositionRelative](Word.WdShapePositionRelative.md)** enumeration), this property should be ignored because the shape does not use percent positioning. The vertical position is solely determined by the **[Top](Word.Shape.Top.md)** property.
