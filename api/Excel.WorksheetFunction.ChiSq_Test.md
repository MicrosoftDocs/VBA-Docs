# WorksheetFunction.ChiSq_Test method (Excel)

Returns the test for independence.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ChiSq_Test`( `_Arg1_` , `_Arg2_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[WorksheetFunction](Excel.WorksheetFunction.md)' object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Arg1_|Required| **Variant**|The range of data that contains observations to test against expected values.|
| _Arg2_|Required| **Variant**|The range of data that contains the ratio of the product of row totals and column totals to the grand total.|

## Return value

Double


## Remarks

ChiSq_Test returns the value from the chi-squared ( 2 ) distribution for the statistic and the appropriate degrees of freedom. You can use ?2 tests to determine whether hypothesized results are verified by an experiment:


- If actual_range and expected_range have a different number of data points, ChiSq_Test returns the #N/A error value.
    
- The 2 test first calculates a ?2 statistic using the formula:
![Formula](../images/awfchtst_ZA06051120.gif)where: A ij = actual frequency in the i-th row, j-th column Eij = expected frequency in the i-th row, j-th column r = number or rows c = number of columns
    
- A low value of 2 is an indicator of independence. As can be seen from the formula, 2 is always positive or 0, and is 0 only if Aij = Eij for every i,j.
    
- ChiSq_Test returns the probability that a value of the 2 statistic at least as high as the value calculated by the above formula could have happened by chance under the assumption of independence. In computing this probability, ChiSq_Test uses the ?2 distribution with an appropriate number of degrees of freedom, df. If r > 1 and c > 1, then df = (r - 1)(c - 1). If r = 1 and c > 1, then df = c - 1 or if r > 1 and c = 1, then df = r - 1. r = c= 1 is not allowed and generates an error.
    
- Use of ChiSq_Test is most appropriate when E ij ?s are not too small. Some statisticians suggest that each Eij should be greater than or equal to 5.
