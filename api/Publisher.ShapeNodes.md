# ShapeNodes Object (Publisher)

A collection of all the  **[ShapeNode](Publisher.ShapeNode.md)** objects in the specified freeform. Each **ShapeNode** object represents either a node between segments in a freeform or a control point for a curved segment of a freeform. You can create a freeform manually or by using the **[BuildFreeform](Publisher.Shapes.BuildFreeform.md)** and **[ConvertToShape](Publisher.FreeformBuilder.ConvertToShape.md)** methods.
 


## Example

Use the  **[Nodes](Publisher.Shape.Nodes.md)** property to return a **ShapeNodes** collection. The following example deletes node four in shape three on the active document. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform with at least four nodes.
 

 

```vb
Sub DeleteShapeNode() 
 ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(3).Nodes.Delete Index:=4 
End Sub
```

Use the  **[Insert](Publisher.ShapeNodes.Insert.md)** method to create a new node and add it to the **ShapeNodes** collection. The following example adds a smooth node with a curved segment after node four in shape three on the active document. For this example to work, shape three must e a freeform with at least four nodes.
 

 



```vb
Sub AddCurvedSmoothSegment() 
 ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(3).Nodes.Insert _ 
 Index:=4, SegmentType:=msoSegmentCurve, _ 
 EditingType:=msoEditingSmooth, X1:=210, Y1:=100 
End Sub
```

Use  **Nodes** (index), where index is the node index number, to return a single **ShapeNode** object. If node one in shape three on the active document is a corner point, the following example makes it a smooth point. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform.
 

 



```vb
Sub SetPointType() 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(3) 
 If .Nodes(1).EditingType = msoEditingCorner Then 
 .Nodes.SetEditingType Index:=1, EditingType:=msoEditingSmooth 
 End If 
 End With 
End Sub
```
