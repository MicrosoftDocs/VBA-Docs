# EmailSignatureEntry object (Word)

Represents a single email signature entry. The **EmailSignatureEntry** object is a member of the **[EmailSignatureEntries](Word.EmailSignatureEntries.md)** collection. The **EmailSignatureEntries** collection contains all the email signature entries available to Word.


## Remarks

Use  **EmailSignatureEntries** (Index), where Index is the email signature entry name or item number, to return a single **EmailSignatureEntry** object. You must match exactly the spelling (but not necessarily the capitalization) of the name. The following example uses the **[Delete](Word.EmailSignatureEntry.Delete.md)** method to delete the signature entry named "Jeff Smith."


```vb
Sub DeleteSignature() 
 Application.EmailOptions.EmailSignature _ 
 .EmailSignatureEntries("jeff smith").Delete 
End Sub
```
