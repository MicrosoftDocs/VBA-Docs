# Document.UndoClear method (Word)

Clears the list of actions that can be undone for the specified document.


## Syntax

_expression_. `UndoClear`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Document](Word.Document.md)** object.


## Remarks

This method corresponds to the list of items that appears when you click the arrow beside the **Undo** button on the **Standard** toolbar. Include this method at the end of a macro to keep Visual Basic actions from appearing in the **Undo** box (for example, "VBA-Selection.InsertAfter").


## Example

This example clears the list of actions that can be undone for the active document.


```vb
ActiveDocument.UndoClear
```
