# Document.Open Event (Word)

Occurs when a document is opened.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you are working with a document embedded within another document, this event will not occur.


## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression_ `Private Sub Document_Open`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Document](Word.Document.md) object.


## Remarks

If the event procedure is stored in a template, the procedure will run when a new document based on that template is opened and when the template itself is opened as a document.

For information about using events with the **Document** object, see [Using Events with the Document Object](../word/Concepts/Objects-Properties-Methods/using-events-with-the-document-object.md).


## Example

This example displays a message when a document is opened. (The procedure can be stored in the **ThisDocument** class module of a document or its attached template.)


```vb
Private Sub Document_Open() 
 MsgBox "This document is copyrighted." 
End Sub
```
