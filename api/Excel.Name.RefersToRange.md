# Name.RefersToRange property (Excel)

Returns the  **[Range](Excel.Range(object).md)** object referred to by a **Name** object. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `RefersToRange`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Name](Excel.Name.md) object.


## Remarks

If the  **Name** object doesn't refer to a range (for example, if it refers to a constant or a formula), this property fails.

To change the range that a name refers to, use the  **[RefersTo](Excel.Name.RefersTo.md)** property.


## Example

This example displays the number of rows and columns in the print area on the active worksheet.


 **Note**  Ensure that you establish a print area on the active sheet of the current workbook.


```vb
p = Sheets(ActiveSheet.Name).Names("Print_Area").RefersToRange.Value 
MsgBox "Print_Area: " & UBound(p, 1) & " rows, " & _ 
 UBound(p, 2) & " columns"
```
