# Items.ItemAdd event (Outlook)

Occurs when one or more items are added to the specified collection. This event does not run when a large number of items are added to the folder at once. This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).


## Syntax

_expression_. `ItemAdd`( _Item_ )

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Items](Outlook.Items.md) object.


## Parameters

|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Item_|Required| **Object**|The item that was added.|

## Example

In this Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example, when a new contact is added to the **Contacts** folder, the contact item is attached to an email message and sent to a distribution list named "Sales Team." The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.

```vb
Public WithEvents myOlItems As Outlook.Items 

Public Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myOlItems = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI").GetDefaultFolder(olFolderContacts).Items 
 
End Sub 
 

Private Sub myOlItems_ItemAdd(ByVal Item As Object) 
 
 Dim myOlMItem As Outlook.MailItem 
 
 Dim myOlAtts As Outlook.Attachments 
 
 Set myOlMItem = myOlApp.CreateItem(olMailItem) 
 
 myOlMItem.Save 
 
 Set myOlAtts = myOlMItem.Attachments 
 
 ' Add new contact to attachments in mail message 
 
 myOlAtts.Add Item, olByValue 
 
 myOlMItem.To = "Sales Team" 
 
 myOlMItem.Subject = "New contact" 
 
 myOlMItem.Send 
 
End Sub
```
