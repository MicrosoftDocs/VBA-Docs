# Document.ConsecutiveHyphensLimit property (Word)

Returns or sets the maximum number of consecutive lines that can end with hyphens. Read/write.  **Long**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ConsecutiveHyphensLimit`

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Document](Word.Document.md)** object.


## Remarks

If the **ConsecutiveHyphensLimit** property is set to 0 (zero), any number of consecutive lines can end with hyphens.


## Example

This example enables automatic hyphenation for MyReport.doc and limits the number of consecutive lines that can end with hyphens to two.


```vb
With Documents("MyReport.doc") 
 .AutoHyphenation = True 
 .ConsecutiveHyphensLimit = 2 
End With
```

This example sets no limit on the number of consecutive lines that can end with hyphens.




```vb
ActiveDocument.ConsecutiveHyphensLimit = 0
```
