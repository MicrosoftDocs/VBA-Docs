# Application.DocumentOpen Event (Word)

Occurs when a document is opened.


## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression_ _'DocumentOpen'(**_ByVal Doc As Document_**)

 _expression_ A variable that represents an '[Application](Word.Application.md)' object declared with events in a class module.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Doc_|Required| **Document**|The document that's being opened.|

## Remarks

 For more information about using events with the **Application** object, see [Using Events with the Application Object](../word/Concepts/Objects-Properties-Methods/using-events-with-the-application-object-word.md).


## Example

This example asks the user whether to save all other open documents when a document is opened. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see [Using Events with the Application Object](../word/Concepts/Objects-Properties-Methods/using-events-with-the-application-object-word.md)for directions on how to accomplish this.


```vb
Public WithEvents appWord as Word.Application 
 
Private Sub appWord_DocumentOpen(ByVal Doc As Document) 
 Dim intResponse As Integer 
 Dim strName As String 
 Dim docLoop As Document 
 
 intResponse = MsgBox("Save all other documents?", vbYesNo) 
 
 If intResponse = vbYes Then 
 strName = ActiveDocument.Name 
 For Each docLoop In Documents 
 With docLoop 
 If .Name <> strName Then 
 .Save 
 End If 
 End With 
 Next docLoop 
 End If 
End Sub
```
