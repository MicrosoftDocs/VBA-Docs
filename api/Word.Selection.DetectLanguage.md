# Selection.DetectLanguage method (Word)

Analyzes the specified text to determine the language that it is written in.


## Syntax

_expression_. `DetectLanguage`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Selection](Word.Selection.md)** object.


## Remarks

The results of the **DetectLanguage** method are stored in the **LanguageID** property on a character-by-character basis. To read the **[LanguageID](Word.Language.ID.md)** property, you must first specify a selection or range of text.

If a selection contains a partial sentence, the selection is extended to the end of the sentence.

If the **DetectLanguage** method has already been applied to the specified text, the **LanguageDetected** property is set to **True**. To reevaluate the language of the specified text, you must first set the **[LanguageDetected](Word.Document.LanguageDetected.md)** property to **False**.
