# Application.Reports method (Project)

The **Reports** method is deprecated in Project.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Reports`

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Application](Project.Application.md)** object.


## Return value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks

The older style of reports that require connection with a printer are deprecated in Project. Running the **Reports** method returns Run-time error 1100, "Application-defined or object-defined error".

For newer types of reports, see the **[ReportsDialog](Project.application.reportsdialog.md)** method for the Office Art types of reports or the **[VisualReports](Project.Application.VisualReports.md)** method for the reports that use Excel and Visio templates.
