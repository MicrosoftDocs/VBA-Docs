## Syntax

For more information about using events with the  **Document** object, see [Using Events with the Document Object](../publisher/Concepts/using-events-with-the-document-object-publisher.md).


## Example

Private Sub Document_Open() 
 MsgBox "This publication is copyrighted." 
End Sub
```
