# Document.ScratchArea Property (Publisher)

Returns a  **[ScratchArea](Publisher.ScratchArea.md)** object for an a given document.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ScratchArea**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **Document** object.


## Return value

ScratchArea


## Remarks

The  **ScratchArea** object is a collection of objects on the scratch page. The **ScratchArea** object is not in the **Pages** collection because it is fundamentally not a page; its only similarity to a page is that it can contain objects.


## Example

This example sets the variable object as the first shape on the scratch area of the active document.


```vb
Sub ScratchPad() 
 
 Dim saPage As ScratchArea 
 Dim objFirst As Object 
 
 saPage = Application.ActiveDocument.ScratchArea 
 objFirst = saPage.Shapes(1) 
 
End Sub
```
