# ThreeDFormat.RotationY property (Excel)

Returns or sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the y-axis in degrees. Can be a value from - 90 through 90. A positive value indicates rotation to the left; a negative value indicates rotation to the right. Read/write  **Single**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `RotationY`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [ThreeDFormat](./Excel.ThreeDFormat.md) object.


## Remarks

To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the x-axis, use the  **[RotationX](Excel.ThreeDFormat.RotationX.md)** property of the **ThreeDFormat** object. To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the z-axis, use the **[Rotation](Excel.Shape.Rotation.md)** property of the **[Shape](Excel.Shape.md)** object. To change the direction of the extrusion's sweep path without rotating the front face of the extrusion, use the **[SetExtrusionDirection](Excel.ThreeDFormat.SetExtrusionDirection.md)** method.


## Example

This example adds three identical extruded ovals to  `myDocument` and sets their rotation around the y-axis to - 30, 0, and 30 degrees, respectively.


```vb
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 30, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = -30 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 70, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = 0 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 110, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationY = 30 
 End With 
End With
```
