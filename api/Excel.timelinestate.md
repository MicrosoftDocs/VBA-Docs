# TimelineState Object (Excel)

The timeline-specific state of a [SlicerCache Object (Excel)](Excel.SlicerCache.md) object.


## Remarks

Supported contiguous ranges can be set through the [TimelineState.SetFilterDateRange Method (Excel)](Excel.timelinestate.setfilterdaterange.md) method. When the Timeline has such a contiguous filter state, the state can be retrieved from the two properties[TimelineState.StartDate Property (Excel)](Excel.timelinestate.startdate.md) and [TimelineState.EndDate Property (Excel)](Excel.timelinestate.enddate.md). Any state that the filter may have, including non-contiguous states, can be retrieved through the three properties: [TimelineState.FilterType Property (Excel)](Excel.timelinestate.filtertype.md), [TimelineState.FilterValue1 Property (Excel)](Excel.timelinestate.filtervalue1.md), and [TimelineState.FilterValue2 Property (Excel)](Excel.timelinestate.filtervalue2.md).
