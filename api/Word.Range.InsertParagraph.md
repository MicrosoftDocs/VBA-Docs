# Range.InsertParagraph method (Word)

Replaces the specified range with a new paragraph.


## Syntax

_expression_. `InsertParagraph`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Range](Word.Range.md)** object.


## Remarks

After this method has been used, the range is the new paragraph.

If you don't want to replace the range, use the **Collapse** method before using this method. The **InsertParagraphAfter** method inserts a new paragraph following a **Range** object.


## Example

This example inserts a new paragraph at the beginning of the active document.


```vb
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Range(0, 0) 
With myRange 
 .InsertParagraph 
 .InsertBefore "Dear Sirs," 
End With
```
