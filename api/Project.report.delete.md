# Report.Delete Method (Project)
Deletes the report.

## Syntax

 _expression_. `Delete`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a 'Report' object.


## Return value

 **Nothing**


## Example

The following example determines whether a report named  **Report 1** exists, and if so, deletes the report. If the report is active, change to another view before you delete it; otherwise, Project shows run-time error 1004: **The table "Report 1" is in use and cannot be copied or deleted.**


```vb
Sub DeleteAReport()
    Dim reportName As String
    
    reportName = "Report 1"
    
    If ActiveProject.Reports.IsPresent(reportName) Then
        ' To delete the active report, change to another view.
        ViewApplyEx Name:="&Gantt Chart"
        
        ActiveProject.Reports(reportName).Delete
    Else
        MsgBox Prompt:="No report name: " & reportName, Title:="Report delete error"
    End If
End Sub
```
