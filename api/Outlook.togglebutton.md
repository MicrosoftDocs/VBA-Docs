# ToggleButton Object (Outlook Forms Script)

Shows the selection state of an item.


## Remarks

Use a  **ToggleButton** to show whether an item is selected. If a **ToggleButton** is bound to a data source, the **ToggleButton** shows the current value of that data source as either Yes/No, True/False, On/Off, or some other choice of two settings. If the user selects the **ToggleButton**, the current setting is Yes, True, or On. If the user does not select the  **ToggleButton**, the setting is No, False, or Off. If the  **ToggleButton** is bound to a data source, changing the setting changes the value of that data source. A disabled **ToggleButton** shows a value, but is dimmed and does not allow changes from the user interface.

You can also use a  **ToggleButton** inside a **[Frame](Outlook.frame.md)** to select one or more of a group of related items. For example, you can create an order form with a list of available items, with a **ToggleButton** preceding each item. The user can select a particular item by selecting the appropriate **ToggleButton**.

The default property of a  **ToggleButton** is the **[Value](Outlook.togglebutton.value.md)** property.

The only event for a  **ToggleButton** is the **[Click](Outlook.togglebutton.click.md)** event.
