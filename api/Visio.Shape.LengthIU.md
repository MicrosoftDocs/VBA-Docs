# Shape.LengthIU Property (Visio)

Returns the length (perimeter) of the shape in internal units. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `LengthIU`( `_fIncludeSubShapes_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Shape](./Visio.Shape.md) object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _fIncludeSubShapes_|Optional| **Boolean**| **False** to exclude the length of subshapes. Length of subshapes is included by default.|

### Return value

Double


## Remarks

Data graphic callout shapes (and their sub-shapes) that are applied to the parent shape are excluded from length calculations. If the parent shape is itself a data graphic callout shape, its geometry (and that of its sub-shapes) is  _not_ excluded from length calculations.

In versions before Microsoft Office Visio 2003, this property took no arguments.
