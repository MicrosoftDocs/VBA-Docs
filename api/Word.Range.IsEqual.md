# Range.IsEqual method (Word)

 **True** if the range to which this method is applied is equal to the range specified by the Range argument.


## Syntax

_expression_. `IsEqual`( `_Range_` )

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Range](Word.Range.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Range_|Required| **Range**|The range to compare with the **Range** object defined by expression.|

## Return value

Boolean


## Remarks

This method compares the starting and ending character positions and the story type. If all three of these items are the same for both objects, the objects are equal.


## Example

This example compares  _Range1_ with _Range2_ to determine whether they're equal. If the two ranges are equal, the content of _Range1_ is deleted.


```vb
Set Range1 = Selection.Words(1) 
Set Range2 = ActiveDocument.Words(3) 
If Range1.IsEqual(Range:=Range2) = True Then 
 Range1.Delete 
End If
```
