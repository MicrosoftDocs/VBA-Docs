The  **Item** method is the default member for a collection. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent:

For more information about returning a single member of a collection, see [Returning an Object from a Collection](../powerpoint/How-to/return-objects-from-collections.md).


## Example

This example sets shape three on slide one to play the sound of applause and uses the  **[AnimateAction](PowerPoint.ActionSetting.AnimateAction.md)** property to specify that the shape's color is to be momentarily inverted when the shape is clicked during a slide show.


```vb
With ActivePresentation.Slides.Item(1).Shapes _
        .Item(3).ActionSettings.Item(ppMouseClick)
    .SoundEffect.Name = "applause"
    .AnimateAction = True
End With
```
