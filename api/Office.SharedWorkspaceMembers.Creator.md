## Syntax

_expression_. `Creator`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [SharedWorkspaceMembers](Office.SharedWorkspaceMembers.md) object.


## Return value

Long


## Remarks

As an example, if the object was created in Microsoft Word, this property returns 1297307460, which represents the string "MSWD"; in Microsoft Excel, this property returns 1480803660. This value can also be represented by the constant wdCreatorCode in Word, or xlCreatorCode in Excel. The  **Creator** property was primarily designed to be used on the Macintosh, where each application has a four-character creator code. For example, Microsoft Word has the creator code MSWD. For additional information about this property, consult the language reference Help included with Microsoft Office Macintosh Edition.

The  **Creator** property always returns the numeric identifier for the active application, just as the **Application** property always returns the name of the active applicatin in string form. Use the **CreatedBy** property of the **SharedWorkspaceFile**, **SharedWorkspaceFolder**, **SharedWorkspaceLink**, and **SharedWorkspaceTask** objects to return the name of the individual who created those objects. Use document properties to return information about the authors of Office documents.
