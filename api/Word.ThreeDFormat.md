# ThreeDFormat object (Word)

Represents a shape's three-dimensional formatting.


## Remarks

Use the **ThreeD** property to return a **ThreeDFormat** object. The following example adds an oval to the active document and then specifies that the oval be extruded to a depth of 50 points and that the extrusion be purple.


```vb
Set myShape = ActiveDocument.Shapes _ 
 .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 90, 90, 90, 40) 
With myShape.ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .Depth = 50 
 ' RGB value for purple 
 .ExtrusionColor.RGB = RGB(255, 100, 255) 
End With
```

You cannot apply three-dimensional formatting to some kinds of shapes, such as beveled shapes or multiple-disjoint paths. Most of the properties and methods of the **ThreeDFormat** object for such a shape will fail.
