# Explorer.Deactivate Event (Outlook)

Occurs when an explorer stops being the active window, either as a result of user action or through program code.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Deactivate`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Explorer](./Outlook.Explorer.md) object.


## Remarks

This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).


## Example

This Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example uses the  **[WindowState](Outlook.Explorer.WindowState.md)** property to minimize the topmost explorer window when it is not active. The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Outlook.


```vb
Public WithEvents myOlExp As Outlook.Explorer 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myOlExp = Application.ActiveExplorer 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlExp_Deactivate() 
 
 myOlExp.WindowState = olMinimized 
 
End Sub
```
