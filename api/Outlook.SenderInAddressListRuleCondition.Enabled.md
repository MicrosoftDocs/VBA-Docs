# SenderInAddressListRuleCondition.Enabled property (Outlook)

Returns or sets a **Boolean** that determines if the rule condition is enabled. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Enabled**

_expression_ A variable that represents a [SenderInAddressListRuleCondition](Outlook.SenderInAddressListRuleCondition.md) object.


## Remarks

After you enable a rule condition, you must also save the rule by using  **[Rules.Save](Outlook.Rules.Save.md)** so that the rule condition and its enabled state will persist beyond the current session. A rule condition is only enabled after it has been saved successfully.
