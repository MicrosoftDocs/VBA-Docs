    Dim reportName As String
    Dim sRange As ShapeRange
    
    reportName = "Apply Report"
    
    Set theReport = ActiveProject.Reports.Add(reportName)
    Set shp1 = theReport.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeCan, 10, 30, 100, 100)
    shp1.Name = "Shape 1"
    shp1.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = &H1010FF  ' Red color.
    
    ' Blue default color.
    Set shp2 = theReport.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeCan, 30, 140, 100, 100)
    
    ' Blue default color.
    Set shp3 = theReport.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeCan, 140, 140, 100, 100)
