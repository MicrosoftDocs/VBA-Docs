# Project.LevelToDate property (Project)

Gets or sets the ending date of a range in which overallocated resources are leveled. The default is the project finish date or the last entered date value. Read/write  **Variant**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `LevelToDate`

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Project](project.project.md)** object.


## Remarks

You can also set the **LevelToDate** property in the **Resource Leveling** dialog box. To access the setting, click **Leveling Options** on the **Resource** tab of the Ribbon, and then click the **Level** option and set the **To** date.


## Example

```vb
Sub ChangeLevelingDates() 
 Dim Response As Long 
 Dim NewFrom As Variant, NewTo As Variant 
 
 With ActiveProject 
 If Application.DateDifference(.ProjectSummaryTask.Start, .LevelFromDate) = 0 Then 
 Response = MsgBox("Overallocated resources are leveled from " & _ 
 "the project start date. Should that be changed?", vbYesNo) 
 If Response = vbYes Then 
 NewFrom = InputBox("Date to level from: ") 
 .LevelFromDate = NewFrom 
 Else 
 MsgBox "Resources remain leveled from the project start date." 
 End If 
 End If 
 
 If Application.DateDifference(.ProjectSummaryTask.Finish, .LevelToDate) = 0 Then 
 Response = MsgBox("Overallocated resources are leveled to " & _ 
 "the project finish date. Should that be changed?", vbYesNo) 
 If Response = vbYes Then 
 NewTo = InputBox("Date to level to: ") 
 .LevelToDate = NewTo 
 Else 
 MsgBox "Resources remain leveled to the project finish date." 
 End If 
 End If
