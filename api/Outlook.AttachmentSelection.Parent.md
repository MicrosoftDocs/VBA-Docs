Returns the parent  **Object** of the specified object. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Parent**

_expression_ A variable that represents an '[AttachmentSelection](Outlook.AttachmentSelection.md)' object.


## Remarks

The **Parent** property of an **AttachmentSelection** object represents the Microsoft Outlook item that contains the selected attachments.

If the item is in an explorer, the value of the  **Parent** property is the same as the first item in the selection that is returned by the **[Explorer.Selection](Outlook.Explorer.Selection.md)** property, which is `Explorer.Selection.Item(1)`. 

If the item is in an inspector, the value of the  **Parent** property is the same as the value of the **[Inspector.CurrentItem](Outlook.Inspector.CurrentItem.md)** property.
