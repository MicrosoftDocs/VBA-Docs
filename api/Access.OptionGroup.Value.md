# OptionGroup.Value property (Access)

Gets or sets whether or not the specified option button is selected. Read/write  **Variant**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Value**

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[OptionGroup](Access.OptionGroup.md)** object.


## Remarks

Set the  **Value** property to **True** to select the option button. The default value is **False**.

The  **Value** property returns or sets a control's default property, which is the property that is assumed when you don't explicitly specify a property name.


 **Note**   The **Value** property is not the same as the **DefaultValue** property, which specifies the value that a property is assigned when a new record is created.
