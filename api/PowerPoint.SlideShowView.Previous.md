# SlideShowView.Previous Method (PowerPoint)

Shows the slide immediately preceding the slide that's currently displayed. 


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Previous`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [SlideShowView](./PowerPoint.SlideShowView.md) object.


## Remarks

If you are currently on the first slide in a kiosk slide show, the  **Previous** method takes you to the last slide in a slide show; otherwise, it has no effect if the first slide in the presentation is currently displayed. Use the **[View](PowerPoint.SlideShowWindow.View.md)** property of the **SlideShowWindow** object to return the **SlideShowView** object.


## Example

This example shows the slide immediately preceding the currently displayed slide on slide show window one.


```vb
SlideShowWindows(1).View.Previous
```
