# Resource.Overallocated property (Project)

 **True** if a resource is overallocated. Read-only **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Overallocated`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Resource](./Project.Resource.md) object.


## Remarks

## Example

```vb
Sub DisplayOverallocatedPercentage() 
 
 Dim R As Resource ' Resource object used in For Each loop 
 Dim NOverallocated As Long ' Number of overallocated resources 
 
 For Each R In ActiveProject.Resources 
 If R.Overallocated Then NOverallocated = NOverallocated + 1 
 Next R 
 
 MsgBox (Str$((NOverallocated / ActiveProject.Resources.Count) * 100) _ 
 & " percent (" & Str$(NOverallocated) & "/" & Str$(ActiveProject.Resources.Count) _ 
 & ")" & " of the resources in this project are overallocated.") 
 
End Sub
```
