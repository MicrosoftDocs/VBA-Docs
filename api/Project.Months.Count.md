# Months.Count property (Project)

Gets the number of items in the **Months** collection for a specified year from 1984 - 2149. Read-only **Integer**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Count**

_expression_ A variable that represents a 'Months' object.


## Examples

The following example in the Immediate window of the VBE returns 12, the number of months in 2012. If you set the year to 1983 or 2150, the result is "Run-time error '1101'; the argument is not valid."


```vb
? activeproject.Resources(1).Calendar.Years(2012).Months.Count
```

The following example shows the use of the **Count** property for the **Assignments** object. It prompts the user for the name of a resource and then assigns that resource to tasks without any resources.




```vb
Sub AssignResource()  
    Dim T As Task ' Task object used in For Each loop  
    Dim R As Resource ' Resource object used in For Each loop  
    Dim Rname As String ' Resource name  
    Dim RID As Long ' Resource ID  
  
    RID = 0  
    RName = InputBox$("Enter the name of a resource: ")  
  
    For Each R in ActiveProject.Resources  
        If R.Name = RName Then  
            RID = R.ID  
            Exit For  
        End If  
    Next R  
  
    If RID <> 0 Then  
        ' Assign the resource to tasks without any resources.  
        For Each T In ActiveProject.Tasks  
            If T.Assignments.Count = 0 Then  
                T.Assignments.Add ResourceID:=RID  
            End If
        Next T
    Else  
        MsgBox Prompt:=RName & " is not a resource in this project.", buttons:=vbExclamation
    End If
End Sub
```
