# Reviewers object (Word)

A collection of  **[Reviewer](Word.Reviewer.md)** objects that represents the reviewers of one or more documents. The **Reviewers** collection contains the names of all reviewers who have reviewed documents opened or edited on a computer.


## Remarks

Use  **Reviewers** (Index), where Index is the name or index number of the reviewer, to return a single reviewer in the **Reviewers** collection. This example hides revisions made by the first reviewer in the **Reviewers** collection.


```vb
Sub HideAuthorRevisions(blnRev As Boolean) 
 ActiveWindow.View.Reviewers(Index:=1) _ 
 .Visible = False 
End Sub
```
