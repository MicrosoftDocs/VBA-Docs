 Set ffNew = .AddShape(Type:=msoShapeOval, _ 
 Left:=0, Top:=0, Width:=200, Height:=90).Fill 
 
 With .Item(1).Fill 
 If .Type = msoFillTextured And _ 
 .TextureType = msoTextureUserDefined Then 
 ffNew.UserTextured _ 
 TextureFile:=.TextureName 
 Else 
 ffNew.PresetTextured _ 
 PresetTexture:=msoTextureGreenMarble
