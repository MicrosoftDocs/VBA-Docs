# Paragraph.OutlineLevel property (Word)

Returns or sets the outline level for the specified paragraph. Read/write  **[WdOutlineLevel](Word.WdOutlineLevel.md)**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**OutlineLevel**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Paragraph](Word.Paragraph.md)' object.


## Remarks

If a paragraph has a heading style applied to it (Heading 1 through Heading 9), the outline level is the same as the heading style and cannot be changed. Outline levels are visible only in outline view or the document map pane.


## Example

This example returns the outline level of the first paragraph in the active document.


```vb
temp = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).OutlineLevel
```

This example sets the outline level for each paragraph in the active document. First the Normal style is applied to all paragraphs. The **Mod** operator is used to determine which outline level (1, 2, or 3) to apply to successive paragraphs in the document, and then the view is changed to outline view.




```vb
Set myParas = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs 
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs.Style = wdStyleNormal 
For x = 1 To myParas.Count 
 If x Mod 3 = 1 Then 
 myParas(x).OutlineLevel = wdOutlineLevel1 
 ElseIf x Mod 3 = 2 Then 
 myParas(x).OutlineLevel = wdOutlineLevel2 
 Else 
 myParas(x).OutlineLevel = wdOutlineLevel3 
 End If 
Next x 
ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.Type = wdOutlineView
```
