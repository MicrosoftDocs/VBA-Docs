# SparkPoints object (Excel)

Represents the settings of the markers for points of data on a sparkline.


## Remarks

Use the **[Points](./overview/Excel.md)** property of the **[SparklineGroup](Excel.SparklineGroup.md)** object to return a **SparkPoints** object. The properties of the **SparkPoints** object correspond to the settings of the **High Point**,  **Low Point**,  **Negative Point**,  **First Point**,  **Last Point**, and  **Markers** check boxes in the **Show** section, and of the items on the **Marker Color** drop-down list in the **Style** section of the ** Sparkline Tools Design** tab of the ribbon.
