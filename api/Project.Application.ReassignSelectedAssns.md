# Application.ReassignSelectedAssns method (Project)

Reassigns the selected assignments in the Team Planner view.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ReassignSelectedAssns`( `_ResourceID_` )

 _expression_ An expression that returns an **[Application](Project.Application.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _ResourceUniqueID_|Required|**Long**|Identification number of the resource for the new assignment, or -65535 for unassigned.|

## Return value

## Remarks

The **ReassignSelectedAssns** method works only with the Team Planner view.

If you use the Team Planner to drag an assignment from one resource to another while you are recording a macro, the macro does not show the results of the drag action. To record a macro that shows the **ReassignSelectedAssns** method, you must right-click an assignment in the Team Planner, and then click **Reassign To** in the option menu.


## Example

The following line of code reassigns the assignments selected in the Team Planner to the resource with ID = 2.


```vb
ReassignSelectedAssns ResourceID:=2
```

The following line of code changes the assignments to unassigned.




```vb
ReassignSelectedAssns ResourceID:=-65535
```
