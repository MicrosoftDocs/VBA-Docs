# PageSetup.VerticalAlignment property (Word)

Returns or sets the vertical alignment of text on each page in a document or section. Read/write  **[WdVerticalAlignment](Word.WdVerticalAlignment.md)**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `VerticalAlignment`

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[PageSetup](Word.PageSetup.md)' object.


## Example

This example changes the vertical alignment of the first document so that the text is centered between the top and bottom margins.

```vb
Set myDoc = Documents.Add 
With myDoc.Content 
 For i = 1 to 9 
 .InsertAfter "This is a sentence." 
 .InsertParagraphAfter 
 Next i

End With 
myDoc.PageSetup.VerticalAlignment = wdAlignVerticalJustify
```
