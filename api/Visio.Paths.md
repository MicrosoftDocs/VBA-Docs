# Paths Object (Visio)

Includes a  **Path** object for each Geometry section for a group or shape.


## Remarks

To retrieve a  **Paths** collection expressed in the shape's parent coordinate system, use the **Paths** property of the shape. The coordinates are expressed in internal drawing units (inches).

The default property of a  **Paths** collection is **Item**.

To retrieve a  **Paths** collection expressed in the shape's local coordinate system, use the **PathsLocal** property of the shape. The coordinates are expressed in internal drawing units (inches).

If a  **Shape** object is a page, foreign object, or guide, its **Paths** and **PathsLocal** properties don't contain any items.

If a  **Shape** object is a group, its **Paths** and **PathsLocal** properties are the union of the paths of its component shapes.

If a  **Shape** object is a shape, its **Paths** and **PathsLocal** properties include one item for each Geometry section that defines a stroke of positive length.
