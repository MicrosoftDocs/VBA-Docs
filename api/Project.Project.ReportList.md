Deprecated in Project. 


## Syntax

_expression_. `ReportList`

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Project](project.project.md)** object.


## Remarks

## Example

The following example lists all the reports in the active project (Project only).


```vb
Sub SeeAllReports() 
 
 Dim Temp As Variant 
 Dim ReportNames As String 
 
 For Each Temp In ActiveProject.ReportList 
 ReportNames = ReportNames & vbCrLf & Temp 
 Next Temp 
 
 MsgBox ReportNames 
 
End Sub
```
