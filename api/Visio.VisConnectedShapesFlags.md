# VisConnectedShapesFlags Enumeration (Visio)

Specifies constants that identify shapes by the directionality of their connectors; passed to the  **[Shape.ConnectedShapes](Visio.Shape.ConnectedShapes.md)** method.


 **Note**  Connection points that have dual directionality (both inward and outward) are identified as either incoming or outgoing based on how they are used in a particular connection.



|Name|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visConnectedShapesAllNodes**|0|The shapes that are connected by using either incoming or outgoing connections.|
| **visConnectedShapesIncomingNodes**|1|The shapes that are connected by using incoming connections.|
