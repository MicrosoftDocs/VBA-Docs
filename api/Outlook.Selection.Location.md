# Selection.Location property (Outlook)

Returns an **[OlSelectionLocation](Outlook.OlSelectionLocation.md)** constant that specifies where in the Microsoft Outlook user interface the current selection is. Read-only


## Syntax

_expression_.**Location** 

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[Selection](Outlook.Selection.md)' object.


## Remarks

A **Location** property with the value **olViewList** means that the current selection is in a list of items in an explorer. Calling **[Selection.GetSelection](Outlook.Selection.GetSelection.md)** with **olConversationHeaders** as the argument returns a **Selection** object with **[Selection.Count](Outlook.Selection.Count.md)** equal to the number of conversation headers in the current selection.

If the  **Location** property is not equal to **olViewList**, calling **GetSelection** with **olConversationHeaders** as the argument returns a **Selection** object with **Selection.Count** equal to 0.
