# Hyperlinks Object (PowerPoint)

A collection of all the  **[Hyperlink](PowerPoint.Hyperlink.md)** objects on a slide or master.


## Example

Use the [Hyperlinks](PowerPoint.Slide.Hyperlinks.md)property to return the  **Hyperlinks** collection. The following example updates all hyperlinks on slide one in the active presentation that have the specified address.


```vb
For Each hl In ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Hyperlinks

    If hl.Address = "c:\current work\sales.ppt" Then

        hl.Address = "c:\new\newsales.ppt"

    End If

Next
```

Use the [Hyperlink](PowerPoint.ActionSetting.Hyperlink.md)property to create a hyperlink and add it to the  **Hyperlinks** collection. The following example sets a hyperlink that will be followed when the user clicks shape three on slide one in the active presentation during a slide show and adds the new hyperlink to the collection. Note that if shape three already has a mouse-click hyperlink defined, the following example will delete this hyperlink from the collection when it adds the new one, so the number of items in the **Hyperlinks** collection won't change.




```vb
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(3) _
        .ActionSettings(ppMouseClick)

    .Action = ppActionHyperlink
    .Hyperlink.Address = "https://www.microsoft.com"

End With
```
