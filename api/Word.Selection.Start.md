# Selection.Start property (Word)

Returns or sets the starting character position of a selection. Read/write  **Long**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Start`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[Selection](Word.Selection.md)' object.


## Remarks

 **Selection** objects have starting and ending character positions. The starting position refers to the character position closest to the beginning of the story. If this property is set to a value larger than that of the **End** property, the **End** property is set to the same value as that of **Start** property.

This property returns the starting character position relative to the beginning of the story. The main text story (**wdMainTextStory**) begins with character position 0 (zero). You can change the size of a selection, range, or bookmark by setting this property.


## Example

This example determines the length of the selection by comparing the starting and ending character positions.


```vb
SelLength = Selection.End - Selection.Start
```
