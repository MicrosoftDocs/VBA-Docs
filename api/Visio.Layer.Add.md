# Layer.Add Method (Visio)

Adds a  **Shape** object to a **Layer** object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Add`( `_SheetObject_` , `_fPresMems_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Layer](./Visio.Layer.md) object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _SheetObject_|Required| **[IVSHAPE]**|The new  **Shape** object added to the **Layer** object.|
| _fPresMems_|Required| **Integer**|Zero to remove subshapes from any previous layer assignments; non-zero to preserve layer assignments.|

### Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

If the shape is a group and  _fPresMems_ is non-zero, the component shapes of the group retain their current layer assignments and are also added to this layer. If _fPresMems_ is zero, the component shapes are reassigned to this layer and lose their current layer assignments.


## Example

The following example shows how to use the  **Add** method to add **Shape** objects to a **Layer** object. When the **Shape** object you add to a **Layer** object is a group shape, use the _fPresMems_ argument of the **Add** method to specify whether the component shapes of the group retain or lose their previous layer assignments. If the shape you add is not a group shape, the _fPresMems_ argument has no effect, but is still required.

In the example, two new layers are created. Two rectangle shapes are drawn and then added to the first layer. Subsequently, the rectangles are grouped into a group shape. The group shape is then selected and duplicated, and the duplicate group shapes are added to the second layer in two different ways.

Layer assignments of the component shapes of  _vsoShapeGroup2_ are retained by passing a non-zero value for the _fPresMems_ argument of the **Add** method, but previous layer assignments of the component shapes of _vsoShapeGroup1_ are lost when zero is passed to the **Add** method for that argument. As a result, the component shapes of _vsoShapeGroup1_ are assigned only to _vsoLayer2_ , while the components of _vsoShapeGroup2_ are assigned to both _vsoLayer1_ and _vsoLayer2_ .
