# QueryTable.Creator property (Excel)

Returns a 32-bit integer that indicates the application in which this object was created. Read-only  **Long**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Creator`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [QueryTable](Excel.QueryTable.md) object.


## Remarks

If the object was created in Microsoft Excel, this property returns the string XCEL, which is equivalent to the hexadecimal number 5843454C. The  **Creator** property is designed to be used in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, where each application has a four-character creator code. For example, Microsoft Excel has the creator code XCEL.

Data from Web queries or text queries is imported as a  **[QueryTable](Excel.QueryTable.md)** object, while all other external data is imported as a **[ListObject](Excel.ListObject.md)** object. You can use the **[QueryTable](Excel.ListObject.QueryTable.md)** property of the **ListObject** to access the **Creator** property.
