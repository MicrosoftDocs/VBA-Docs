# Document.OMathBreakBin property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **[WdOMathBreakBin](Word.WdOMathBreakBin.md)** constant that represents where Microsoft Word places binary operators when equations span two or more lines. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `OMathBreakBin`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [Document](./Word.Document.md) object.


## Remarks

When the equation breaks on a binary operator—for example, an addition, subtraction, or multiplication operator—there are three different placements of the operator: before the break, after the break, and repeated both before and after the break.

When this property is set to  **wdOMathBreakBinRepeat** , use the **[OMathBreakSub](Word.Document.OMathBreakSub.md)** property to specify how Word treats subtraction operators that appear before a line break.
