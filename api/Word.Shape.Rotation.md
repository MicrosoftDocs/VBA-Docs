# Shape.Rotation property (Word)

Returns or sets the number of degrees the specified shape is rotated around the z-axis. A positive value indicates clockwise rotation; a negative value indicates counterclockwise rotation. Read/write  **Single**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Rotation**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Shape](Word.Shape.md)** object.


## Remarks

To set the rotation of a three-dimensional shape around the x-axis or the y-axis, use the **RotationX** property or the **RotationY** property of the **ThreeDFormat** object.


## Example

This example matches the rotation of all shapes on myDocument to the rotation of shape one.


```vb
Set myDocument = ActiveDocument 
With myDocument.Shapes 
 sh1Rotation = .Item(1).Rotation

 .Item(o).Rotation = sh1Rotation

End With
```
