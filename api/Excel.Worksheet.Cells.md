# Worksheet.Cells Property (Excel)

Returns a  **[Range](Excel.Range(object).md)** object that represents all the cells on the worksheet (not just the cells that are currently in use).


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Cells`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Worksheet](./Excel.Worksheet.md) object.


## Remarks

Because the  **[Item](Excel.Range.Item.md)** property is the default property for the **Range** object, you can specify the row and column index immediately after the **Cells** keyword. For more information, see the **Item** property and the examples for this topic.

Using this property without an object qualifier returns a  **Range** object that represents all the cells on the active worksheet.


## Example

This example sets the font size for cell C5 on Sheet1 to 14 points.


```vb
Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells(5, 3).Font.Size = 14
```

This example clears the formula in cell one on Sheet1.




```vb
Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells(1).ClearContents
```

This example sets the font and font size for every cell on Sheet1 to 8-point Arial




```vb
With Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells.Font 
    .Name = "Arial" 
    .Size = 8 
End With
```

This example toggles a sort between ascending and descending order when you double-click any cell in the data range. The data is sorted based on the column of the cell that is double-clicked.




```vb
Option Explicit
Public blnToggle As Boolean

Private Sub Worksheet_BeforeDoubleClick(ByVal Target As Range, Cancel As Boolean)
    Dim LastColumn As Long, keyColumn As Long, LastRow As Long
    Dim SortRange As Range
    LastColumn = Cells.Find(What:="*", After:=Range("A1"), SearchOrder:=xlByColumns, SearchDirection:=xlPrevious).Column
    
    keyColumn = Target.Column
    
    If keyColumn <= LastColumn Then
    
        Application.ScreenUpdating = False
        Cancel = True
        LastRow = Cells(Rows.Count, keyColumn).End(xlUp).Row
        Set SortRange = Target.CurrentRegion
        
        blnToggle = Not blnToggle
        If blnToggle = True Then
            SortRange.Sort Key1:=Cells(2, keyColumn), Order1:=xlAscending, Header:=xlYes
        Else
            SortRange.Sort Key1:=Cells(2, keyColumn), Order1:=xlDescending, Header:=xlYes
        End If
    
        Set SortRange = Nothing
        Application.ScreenUpdating = True
        
    End If
End Sub
```
