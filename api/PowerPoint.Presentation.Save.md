# Presentation.Save Method (PowerPoint)

Saves the specified presentation.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Save`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Presentation](./PowerPoint.Presentation.md) object.


## Remarks

Use the  **[SaveAs](PowerPoint.Presentation.SaveAs.md)** method to save a presentation that has not been previously saved. To determine whether a presentation has been saved, test for a nonempty value for the **[FullName](PowerPoint.Presentation.FullName.md)** or **[Path](PowerPoint.Presentation.Path.md)** property. If a document that has the same name as the specified presentation already exists on disk, that document will be overwritten. No warning message is displayed.

To mark the presentation as saved without writing it to disk, set the  **Saved** property to **True**.


## Example

This example saves the active presentation if it is been changed since the last time it was saved.


```vb
With Application.ActivePresentation

    If Not .Saved And .Path <> "" Then .Save

End With


```
