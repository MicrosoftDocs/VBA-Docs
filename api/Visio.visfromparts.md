# VisFromParts Enumeration (Visio)

Codes returned by the  **Connect.FromPart** property.


 **Note**  The  **visControlPoint** value is actually 100 plus the zero-based row index. For example, if the control point is in row 0, **visControlPoint** equals 100; if the control point is in row 1, **visControlPoint** equals 101.


## Remarks

The  **VisFromParts** return codes indicate the part of a shape from which a connection originates.
