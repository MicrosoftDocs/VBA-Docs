# Window.ScrollLock Property (Visio)

Determines whether scrolling is disabled in a Microsoft Visio window. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ScrollLock`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Window](./Visio.Window.md) object.


## Return value

Boolean


## Remarks

Scrolling (**False**) is the default Visio behavior. You can set the **ScrollLock** property to **True** to prevent scrolling in any Visio window, including docked stencil windows, but not including anchored windows.

The  **ScrollLock** property setting is valid only for a given window at run time, and is not persisted (saved) in either the Visio document or the registry.
