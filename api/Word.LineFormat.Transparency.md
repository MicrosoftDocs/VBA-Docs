# LineFormat.Transparency property (Word)

Returns or sets the degree of transparency of line. Read/write  **Single**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Transparency`

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[LineFormat](Word.LineFormat.md)' object.


## Remarks

 The value of this property can be expressed as a value between 0.0 (opaque) and 1.0 (clear). This property affects the appearance of solid-colored lines only; it has no effect on the appearance of patterned lines.


## Example

This example sets the shadow of shape three in the active document to semitransparent red. If the shape doesn't already have a shadow, this example adds one to it.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Shapes(3).Shadow 
 .Visible = True 
 .ForeColor.RGB = RGB(255, 0, 0) 
 .Transparency = 0.5 
End With
```
