# PictureFormat.RestoreOriginalColors Method (Publisher)

Restores the original colors of a picture that was recolored.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **RestoreOriginalColors**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **PictureFormat** object.


## Remarks

The  **RestoreOriginalColors** method corresponds to the **Restore Original Colors** button in the **Recolor Picture** dialog box. (On the **Format** menu, click **Picture**, and then click  **Recolor**)


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **RestoreOriginalColors** method to restore the original colors of a picture that was recolored by using the ** [PictureFormat.Recolor](Publisher.PictureFormat.Recolor.md)** method. It recolors the first shape in the **Shapes** collection on the first page of the publication and then restores its original colors.

For this example to work, the recolored shape must be either a picture or an OLE object that represents a picture.




```vb
Public Sub RestoreOriginalColors_Example() 
 
 Dim pubPictureFormat As Publisher.PictureFormat 
 Dim pubShape As Publisher.Shape 
 Dim pubColorFormat As Publisher.ColorFormat 
 
 Set pubShape = ThisDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1) 
 
 Set pubPictureFormat = pubShape.PictureFormat 
 Set pubColorFormat = pubShape.Fill.BackColor 
 
 pubPictureFormat.Recolor pubColorFormat, msoTrue 
 MsgBox "Picture was recolored." 
 pubPictureFormat.RestoreOriginalColors 
 MsgBox "Original colors in picture were restored." 
 
 
End Sub
```
