# AllForms Object (Access)

The  **AllForms** collection contains an **[AccessObject](Access.AccessObject.md)** object for each form in the **[CurrentProject](Access.CurrentProject.md)** or **[CodeProject](Access.CodeProject.md)** object.


## Remarks

The  **CurrentProject** and **CodeProject** object has an **AllForms** collection containing **AccessObject** objects that describe instances of all the forms in the database. For example, you can enumerate the **AllForms** collection in Visual Basic to set or return the values of properties of individual **AccessObject** objects in the collection.

You can refer to an individual  **AccessObject** object in the **AllForms** collection either by referring to the object by name, or by referring to its index within the collection. If you want to refer to a specific object in the **AllForms** collection, it's better to refer to the form by name because a form's collection index may change.

The  **AllForms** collection is indexed beginning with zero. If you refer to a form by its index, the first form is AllForms(0), the second form is AllForms(1), and so on.


 **Note**  To list all open forms in the database, use the  **[IsLoaded](Access.AccessObject.IsLoaded.md)** property of each **AccessObject** object in the **AllForms** collection. You can then use the **Name** property of each individual **AccessObject** object to return the name of a form.

You can't add or delete an  **AccessObject** object from the **AllForms** collection.


## Example

The following example prints the name of each open  **AccessObject** object in the **AllForms** collection.


```vb
Sub AllForms() 
    Dim obj As AccessObject, dbs As Object 
    Set dbs = Application.CurrentProject 
    ' Search for open AccessObject objects in AllForms collection. 
    For Each obj In dbs.AllForms 
        If obj.IsLoaded = True Then 
            ' Print name of obj. 
            Debug.Print obj.Name 
        End If 
    Next obj 
End Sub
```

The following example shows how to prevent a user form opening a particular form directly from the Navigation Pane.

```vb
'Don't let this form be opened from the Navigator
If Not CurrentProject.AllForms(cFormUsage).IsLoaded Then
    MsgBox "This form cannot be opened from the Navigation Pane.", _
        vbInformation + vbOKOnly, "Invalid form usage"
    Cancel = True
    Exit Sub
End If
```
