# Shape.Ungroup method (Word)

Ungroups any grouped shapes in the specified shape.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Ungroup**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Shape](Word.Shape.md)** object.


## Return value

ShapeRange


## Remarks

This method sisassembles pictures and OLE objects within the specified shapeand returns the ungrouped shapes as a single  **[ShapeRange](Word.shaperange.md)** object.

Because a group of shapes is treated as a single object, grouping and ungrouping shapes changes the number of items in the **Shapes** collection and changes the index numbers of items that come after the affected items in the collection.


## Example

This example ungroups any grouped shapes and disassembles any pictures or OLE objects on _myDocument_.


```vb
Set myDocument = ActiveDocument 
For Each s In myDocument.Shapes 
 s.Ungroup 
Next
```

This example ungroups any grouped shapes on _myDocument_ without disassembling pictures or OLE objects on the document.




```vb
Set myDocument = ActiveDocument 
For Each s In myDocument.Shapes 
 If s.Type = msoGroup Then s.Ungroup 
Next
```
