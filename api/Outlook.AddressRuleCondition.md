# AddressRuleCondition Object (Outlook)

Represents a rule condition that evaluates whether the address for the recipient or sender of the message is contained in the address specified in  **[AddressRuleCondition.Address](Outlook.AddressRuleCondition.Address.md)**.


## Remarks

 **AddressRuleCondition** is derived from the **[RuleCondition](Outlook.RuleCondition.md)** object. Each rule is associated with a **[RuleConditions](Outlook.RuleConditions.md)** object which has a **[RecipientAddress](Outlook.RuleConditions.RecipientAddress.md)** property and a **[SenderAddress](Outlook.RuleConditions.SenderAddress.md)**. Each of these properties always returns a **AddressRuleCondition** object. **[AddressRuleCondition.ConditionType](Outlook.AddressRuleCondition.ConditionType.md)** distinguishes among these rule conditions. If the rule has any of these rule conditions enabled, then **[AddressRuleCondition.Enabled](Outlook.AddressRuleCondition.Enabled.md)** would be **True**.

For more information on specifying rule actions, see [Specifying Rule Conditions](../outlook/How-to/Rules/specifying-rule-conditions.md).
