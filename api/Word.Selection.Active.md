# Selection.Active property (Word)

 **True** if the selection in the specified window or pane is active. Read-only **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Active`

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Selection](Word.Selection.md)' object.


## Example

This example splits the active window into two panes and activates the selection in the first pane, if it isn't already active.


```vb
Sub SplitWindow() 
 ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Split = True 
 If ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Panes(1).Selection _ 
 .Active = False Then 
 ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Panes(1).Activate 
 End If 
End Sub
```
