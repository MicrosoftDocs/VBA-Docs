# ApplicationSettings Object (Visio)

Represents various application settings for Microsoft Visio.


## Remarks

Use the  **Settings** property of the **Application** object to get an **ApplicationSettings** object, which you can then use to set various application properties corresponding to those in the **Options** dialog box (click the **File** tab, and then click **Options**) and the  **Snap & Glue** dialog box (on the **View** tab, click the **Visual Aids** arrow).

The  **ApplicationSettings** object has no default property.
