# Selection.SetRange method (Word)

Sets the starting and ending character positions for the selection.


## Syntax

_expression_. `SetRange`( `_Start_` , `_End_` )

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Selection](Word.Selection.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Start_|Required| **Long**|The starting character position of the selection.|
| _End_|Required| **Long**|The ending character position of the selection.|

## Remarks

Character position values start at the beginning of the story, with the first value being 0 (zero). All characters are counted, including nonprinting characters. Hidden characters are counted even if they're not displayed.

The **SetRange** method redefines the starting and ending positions of an existing **Selection** object. This method differs from the **Range** method, which is used to create a **Range** object, given a starting and ending position.


## Example

This example selects the first 10 characters in the document.


```vb
Selection.SetRange Start:=0, End:=10
```

This example extends the selection to the end of the document.




```vb
Selection.SetRange Start:=Selection.Start, _ 
 End:=ActiveDocument.Content.End
```
