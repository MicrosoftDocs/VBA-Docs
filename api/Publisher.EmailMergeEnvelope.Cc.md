# EmailMergeEnvelope.Cc Property (Publisher)

Gets or sets the  **MailMergeDataField** object that represents the data-source field (column) that lists the e-mail addresses of recipients you want to receive a carbon copy (CC) of the merged e-mail message. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Cc**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an  **EmailMergeEnvelope** object.


### Return value

MailMergeDataField


## Remarks

You must make certain that you assign the correct data-source field (the one that represents CC e-mail addresses) to the  **Cc** property. You can use the following line of code, which gets the value of the **Name** property of the **MailMergeDataField** object to which **Cc** is assigned, to ensure that you make the correct assignment:


```vb
Debug.Print ThisDocument.MailMerge.EmailMergeEnvelope.Cc.Name
```

For an example of how to set the  **Cc** property value, see the **[EmailMergeEnvelope](Publisher.EmailMergeEnvelope.md)** object topic.
