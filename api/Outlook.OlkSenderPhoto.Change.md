# OlkSenderPhoto.Change Event (Outlook)

Occurs when the sender's contact picture has changed. 


## Syntax

_expression_. `Change`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [OlkSenderPhoto](./Outlook.OlkSenderPhoto.md) object.


## Remarks

The change of the sender's contact picture usually means that the  **[PreferredWidth](Outlook.OlkSenderPhoto.PreferredWidth.md)** and **[PreferredHeight](Outlook.OlkSenderPhoto.PreferredHeight.md)** properties have changed as well. Therefore, this event can be used as an indication of the necessity to resize the control.
