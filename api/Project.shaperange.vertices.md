# ShapeRange.Vertices property (Project)
Gets the coordinates of the vertices (and control points for a BÃ©zier curve) as a series of coordinate pairs, for a shape range that contains a drawing. Read-only  **Variant**.

## Syntax

_expression_.**Vertices**

_expression_ A variable that represents a 'ShapeRange' object.


## Remarks

You can use the array returned by the **Vertices** property as an argument for the [AddCurve](Project.shapes.addcurve.md) method or the [AddPolyLine](Project.shapes.addpolyline.md) method.

For an array of vertices named  `vertArray`, the following table shows how the **Vertices** property associates values in the array with the coordinates of vertices in a triangle.



|**Element in the array**|**Value of the element (in points)**|
|:-----|:-----|
| `vertArray(1, 1)`|The horizontal distance from the first vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(1, 2)`|The vertical distance from the first vertex to the top of the document.|
| `vertArray(2, 1)`|The horizontal distance from the second vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(2, 2)`|The vertical distance from the second vertex to the top of the document.|
| `vertArray(3, 1)`|The horizontal distance from the third vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(3, 2)`|The vertical distance from the third vertex to the top of the document.|

## Property value

 **VARIANT**
