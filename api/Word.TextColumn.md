# TextColumn object (Word)

Represents a single text column. The **TextColumn** object is a member of the **[TextColumns](Word(textcolumns).md)** collection. The **TextColumns** collection includes all the columns in a document or section of a document.


## Remarks

Use  **TextColumns** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **TextColumn** object. The index number represents the position of the column in the **TextColumns** collection (counting from left to right).

The following example sets the space after the first text column in the active document to 0.5 inch.




```vb
ActiveDocument.PageSetup.TextColumns(1).SpaceAfter = _ 
 InchesToPoints(0.5)
```

Use the **Add** method to add a column to the collection of columns. By default, there is one text column in the **TextColumns** collection. The following example adds a 2.5-inch-widecolumn to the active document.




```vb
ActiveDocument.PageSetup.TextColumns.Add _ 
 Width:=InchesToPoints(2.5), _ 
 Spacing:=InchesToPoints(0.5), EvenlySpaced:=False
```

Use the **SetCount** method to arrange text into columns. The following example arranges the text in the active document into three columns.




```vb
ActiveDocument.PageSetup.TextColumns.SetCount NumColumns:=3
```
