# Worksheet.Next property (Excel)

Returns a  **[Worksheet](Excel.Worksheet.md)** object that represents the next sheet.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Next`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Worksheet](./Excel.Worksheet.md) object.


## Remarks

If the object is a range, this property emulates the TAB key, although the property returns the next cell without selecting it.

On a protected sheet, this property returns the next unlocked cell. On an unprotected sheet, this property always returns the cell immediately to the right of the specified cell.


## Example

This example selects the next unlocked cell on Sheet1. If Sheet1 is unprotected, this is the cell immediately to the right of the active cell.


```vb
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
ActiveCell.Next.Select 

```
