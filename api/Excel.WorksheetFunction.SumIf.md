# WorksheetFunction.SumIf Method (Excel)

Adds the cells specified by a given criteria.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `SumIf`( `_Arg1_` , `_Arg2_` , `_Arg3_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [WorksheetFunction](./Excel.WorksheetFunction.md) object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Arg1_|Required| **Range**|Range - the range of cells that you want evaluated by criteria.|
| _Arg2_|Required| **Variant**|Criteria - the criteria in the form of a number, expression, or text that defines which cells will be added. For example, criteria can be expressed as 32, "32", ">32", or "apples".|
| _Arg3_|Optional| **Variant**|Sum_range - the actual cells to add if their corresponding cells in range match criteria. If sum_range is omitted, the cells in range are both evaluated by criteria and added if they match criteria.|

### Return value

Double


## Remarks




- Sum_range does not have to be the same size and shape as range. The actual cells that are added are determined by using the top, left cell in sum_range as the beginning cell, and then including cells that correspond in size and shape to range. For example:
    

|**If range is**|**And sum_range is**|**Then the actual cells are**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|A1:A5|B1:B5|B1:B5|
|A1:A5|B1:B3|B1:B5|
|A1:B4|C1:D4|C1:D4|
|A1:B4|C1:C2|C1:D4|

- You can use the wildcard characters, question mark (?) and asterisk (*), in criteria. A question mark matches any single character; an asterisk matches any sequence of characters. If you want to find an actual question mark or asterisk, type a tilde (~) preceding the character.
