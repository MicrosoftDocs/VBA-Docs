 Dim NewName As String ' New name of project 
 
 ' Check each open project for read-only access. 
 For Each P In Application.Projects 
 If P.ReadOnly Then ' See if project has read-only access. 
 OldName = P.Name ' Store its name. 
 Path = P.Path ' Store its path. 
 ' Create a new name for the file and save it. 
 NewName = "New " & Left(OldName, Len(OldName) - 4) & ".MPP"
