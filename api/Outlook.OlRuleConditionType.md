## Remarks

The list of rule condition types in this enumeration includes all the rule conditions and exception conditions that the Rules and Alerts Wizard supports. Note that while you can programmatically enumerate all the rule conditions and exception conditions for a rule, you can programmatically create a rule with only the most commonly used conditions. For more information, see [Specifying Rule Conditions](../outlook/How-to/Rules/specifying-rule-conditions.md).

For example, the rule condition types  **olConditionDateRange** and **olConditionSizeRange** are supported only for enumeration and enabling or disabling in an existing rule. You cannot programmatically create a rule with such conditions. You cannot programmatically get or set the values of x and y that represent the range.
