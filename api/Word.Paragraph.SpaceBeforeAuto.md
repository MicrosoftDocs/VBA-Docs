# Paragraph.SpaceBeforeAuto property (Word)

 **True** if Microsoft Word automatically sets the amount of spacing before the specified paragraphs. Read/write **Long**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `SpaceBeforeAuto`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[Paragraph](Word.Paragraph.md)' object.


## Remarks

This property returns  **wdUndefined** if the **SpaceBeforeAuto** property is set to **True** for only some of the specified paragraphs. Can be set to either **True** or **False**.

If  **SpaceBeforeAuto** is set to **True**, the **SpaceBefore** property is ignored.

```vb
Select Case ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).SpaceBeforeAuto 
 Case True 
 x = "Spacing before paragraphs is handled " _ 
 & "automatically for all paragraphs." 
 Case False 
 x = "Spacing before paragraphs is handled " _ 
 & "manually for all paragraphs." 
 Case wdUndefined 
 x = "Spacing before paragraphs is handled " _ 
 & "automatically for some paragraphs, " _ 
 & "manually for some paragraphs."
