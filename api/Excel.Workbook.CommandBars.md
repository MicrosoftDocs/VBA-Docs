# Workbook.CommandBars property (Excel)

Returns a  **[CommandBars](Office.CommandBars.md)** object that represents the Microsoft Excel command bars. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `CommandBars`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [Workbook](./Excel.Workbook.md) object.


## Remarks

Used with the  **[Application](Excel.Application(object).md)** object, this property returns the set of built-in and custom command bars available to the application.

When a workbook is embedded in another application and activated by the user by double-clicking the workbook, using this property with a  **[Workbook](Excel.Workbook.md)** object returns the set of Microsoft Excel command bars available within the other application. At all other times, using this property with a **Workbook** object returns **Nothing**.

There is no programmatic way to return the set of command bars attached to a workbook.


## Example

This example deletes all custom command bars that aren't visible.


```vb
For Each bar In Application.CommandBars 
    If Not bar.BuiltIn And Not bar.Visible Then bar.Delete 
Next
```
