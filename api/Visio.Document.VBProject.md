# Document.VBProject Property (Visio)

Returns an automation object that you can use to control the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) project of the document. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `VBProject`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Document](./Visio.Document.md) object.


### Return Value

Object


## Remarks

To get information about the object returned by the  **VBProject** property, follow these steps:


### To get information about the object returned by the VBProject property


1. In the  **Code** group on the [Developer](../visio/How-to/run-visio-in-developer-mode.md) tab, click **Visual Basic**.
    
2. In the Visual Basic Editor, on the  **Tools** menu, click **References**.
    
3. In the  **References** dialog box, click **Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3**, and then click  **OK**.
    
4. On the  **View** menu, click **Object Browser**.
    
5. In the  **Project/Library** list, select the **VBIDE** type library.
    
6. In the  **Classes** list, examine the class named **VBProject**.
    
If no VBA project already exists in the document, the  **VBProject** property creates one.

Beginning with Visio 2002, the  **VBProject** property raises an exception if you are running in a security-enhanced environment and your system administrator has blocked access to the Visual Basic object model. There is no user interface or programmatic way to turn this onâ€”the system administrator must turn on (or off) access by setting a Group Policy. This helps protect against viruses that spread by accessing the Visual Basic projects in commonly used templates and injecting the virus code into them.


## Example

This VBA macro shows how to print the names of libraries referenced by a VBA project in the Immediate window.

Before running this code, make sure the  **Trust access to the VBA project object model** check box is selected under **Developer Macro Settings** on the **Macro Settings** page of the **Trust Center** dialog box (click the **File** tab, click **Options**, click  **Trust Center**, and then click  **Trust Center Settings**). 




```vb
Public Sub VBProject_Example()  
 
    Dim varThisProject As Variant 
    Dim intReferences As Integer 
 
    Set varThisProject = ThisDocument.VBProject  
 
    intReferences = varThisProject.References.Count  
    While intReferences > 0  
        Debug.Print varThisProject.References(intReferences).Name  
        intReferences = intReferences - 1  
    Wend 
 
End Sub
```
