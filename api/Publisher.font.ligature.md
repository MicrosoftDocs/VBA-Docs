# Font.Ligature Property (Publisher)

Returns or sets a  **[pbLigaturePresetType](Publisher.pbligaturepresettype.md)** constant that represents the state of the **Ligature** property on the characters in a text range. The **Ligature** property enables embellishments to the characters, often in the form of bigger and more flamboyant serifs. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Ligature**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **[Font](Publisher.Font.md)** object.


## Return Value

 **pbLigaturePresetType**


## Remarks

> [!NOTE] 
> The  **Ligature** property has an effect only for OpenType fonts that contain ligatures.

Ligatures are alternate appearances of sequences of characters; multiple characters are merged into one glyph. For example, when ligatures are turned on for the word  _Office_, the letters  _ffi_ are all joined together into one glyph that displays a continuous line from the first _f_ through the dot in the _i_.
