# InvisibleApp.QueryCancelPageDelete Event (Visio)

Occurs before the application deletes a page in response to a user action in the interface. If any event handler returns  **True** , the operation is canceled.


## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression_ _'QueryCancelPageDelete'(**_ByVal Page As [IVPAGE]_**)

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [InvisibleApp](./Visio.InvisibleApp.md) object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Page_|Required| **[IVPAGE]**|The page that is going to be deleted.|

## Remarks

A Visio instance fires  **QueryCancelPageDelete** after the user has directed the instance to delete a page.




- If any event handler returns  **True** (cancel), the instance fires **PageDeleteCanceled** and does not delete the page.
    
- If all handlers return  **False** (don't cancel) the instance fires **BeforePageDelete** and then deletes the page.
    


While a Microsoft Visio instance is firing a query or cancel event, it responds to inquiries from client code but refuses to perform operations. Client code can show forms or message boxes while responding to a query or cancel event.

If you're using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event codes](../visio/Concepts/event-codesvisio.md).
