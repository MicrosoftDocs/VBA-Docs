# OutlineCode.OnlyLeaves Property (Project)

 **True** if only outline code lookup table values without children can be selected. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `OnlyLeaves`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [OutlineCode](./Project.OutlineCode.md) object.


## Remarks

If there are no values in the outline code lookup table, then  **OnlyLeaves** is **False** and non-writeable. For enterprise text fields with a lookup table, **OnlyLeaves** is always **False** and non-writeable.
