# EmailSignature object (Word)

Contains information about the email signatures used by Microsoft Word when you create and edit email messages and replies.


## Remarks

Use the **EmailSignature** property to return the **EmailSignature** object.

This example changes the signatures Word appends to new outgoing email messages and email message replies.




```vb
With Application.EmailOptions.EmailSignature 
 .NewMessageSignature = "Signature1" 
 .ReplyMessageSignature = "Reply2" 
End With
```


> [!NOTE] 
> There is no EmailSignatures collection; each  **[EmailOptions](Word.EmailOptions.md)** object contains only one **EmailSignature** object.
