# ChartBorder object (Word)

Represents the border of an object.


## Remarks

Most bordered objects have a border that is treated as a single entity, regardless of how many sides it has. The entire border must be returned as a unit. To return a  **Border** object, use the **Border** property for the particular bordered object (for example, the **[Border](Word.Trendline.Border.md)** property of a **[TrendLine](Word.Trendline.md)** object).


## Example

 The following example changes the type and line style of a trendline on the active chart.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Chart.SeriesCollection(1).Trendlines(1) 
 .Type = xlLinear 
 .Border.LineStyle = xlDash 
End With
```
