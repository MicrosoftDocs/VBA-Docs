# Range.Errors Property (Excel)

Allows the user to access error checking options.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Errors`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Range](Excel.Range(Graph property).md) object.


## Remarks

Reference the  **[Errors](Excel.Errors.md)** object to view a list of index values associated with error checking options.


## Example

In this example, a number written as text is placed in cell A1. Microsoft Excel then determines if the number is written as text in cell A1 and notifies the user accordingly.


```vb
Sub CheckForErrors() 
 
 Range("A1").Formula = "'12" 
 
 If Range("A1").Errors.Item(xlNumberAsText).Value = True Then 
 MsgBox "The number is written as text." 
 Else 
 MsgBox "The number is not written as text." 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
