# XmlMap.ImportXml method (Excel)

Imports XML data from a  **String** variable into cells that have been mapped to the specified **[XmlMap](Excel.XmlMap.md)** object.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ImportXml`( `_XmlData_` , `_Overwrite_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [XmlMap](./Excel.XmlMap.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _XmlData_|Required| **String**|The string that contains the XML data to import.|
| _Overwrite_|Optional| **Variant**|Specifies whether to overwrite the contents of cells that are currently mapped to the specified XML map. Set to  **True** to overwrite the cells; set to **False** to append the data to the existing range. If this parameter is not specified, the current value of the **[AppendOnImport](Excel.XmlMap.AppendOnImport.md)** property of the XML map determines whether the contents of cells are overwritten or not.|

## Return value

[XlXmlImportResult](Excel.XlXmlImportResult.md)


## Remarks



| **xlXmlImportResult** can be one of the following **xlXmlImportResult** constants.|
| **xlXmlImportElementsTruncated**. The contents of the specified XML data file have been truncated because the XML data file is too large for the worksheet.|
| **xlXmlImportSuccess**. The XML data file was successfully imported.|
| **xlXmlImportValidationFailed**. The data being imported failed schema validation, but was imported anyway.|

To import the contents of an XML data file into cells mapped to a specific schema map, use the  **[Import](Excel.XmlMap.Import.md)** method of the **XmlMap** object.

If either of the following conditions is true, a runtime error will occur. If more than one condition is true, Excel returns a runtime error for the most severe (they are listed below with the most severe listed first):


- If the XML data contains syntactical errors.
    
- If import is cancelled because not all of the data could fit in the worksheet.
