# VisWebPageSettings.TargetPath Property (Visio Save As Web)

Specifies the path where the Web page and its supporting files are placed. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **TargetPath**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  ** [VisWebPageSettings](./overview/Visio.md)** object.


## Return value

 **String**


## Remarks

When you save a drawing as a Web page, you must use the  **TargetPath** property to supply the full target path. The **TargetPath** property is reset to a null value after each export: each time you save a drawing as a Web page you must explicitly supply the target path. In addition, the **TargetPath** value is not persisted between sessions of Visio.

The value of the **TargetPath** property corresponds to the folder name and file name selected in the **Save As** dialog box (click the **BackstageButton** tab, and then click **Save As**).


## Example

The following macro shows how to save the active document as a Web page and place the resulting HTML file and supporting files as flat files in the  _targetpath_ folder. Because the **[StoreInFolder](Visio.StoreInFolder.md)** property is set to **False**, the supporting files are placed in the same folder as the root HTML file, instead of in a separate folder that has the name  _filename_files_ or _filename.files_, depending on the language.


```vb
Public Sub TargetPath_Example()
    Dim vsoSaveAsWeb As VisSaveAsWeb 
    Dim vsowebSettings As VisWebPageSettings

    Set vsoSaveAsWeb = Visio.Application.SaveAsWebObject 
    Set vsoWebSettings = vsoSaveAsWeb.WebPageSettings
 
    With vsoWebSettings
         .StoreInFolder = False
         .TargetPath = "<variable>targetpath\filename.htm</variable>"
    End With
 
    vsoSaveAsWeb.CreatePages 
End Sub
```
