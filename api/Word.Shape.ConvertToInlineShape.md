# Shape.ConvertToInlineShape method (Word)

Converts the specified shape in the drawing layer of a document to an inline shape in the text layer. You can convert only shapes that represent pictures, OLE objects, or ActiveX controls. This method returns an  **[InlineShape](Word.inlineShape.md)** object that represents the picture or OLE object.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ConvertToInlineShape`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Shape](Word.Shape.md)** object.


## Remarks

Shapes that support attached text cannot be converted to inline shapes. For these shapes, use the **ConvertToFrame** method.



If you use this method on a  **ShapeRange** object that contains more than one shape, an error occurs.




## Example

This example converts each picture in MyDoc.doc to an inline shape.


```vb
For Each s In Documents("MyDoc.doc").Shapes 
 If s.Type = msoPicture Then 
 s.ConvertToInlineShape 
 End If 
Next s
```
