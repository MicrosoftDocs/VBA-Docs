# Application.Visible property (Project)

 **True** if the application is visible. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Visible**

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Application](Project.Application.md)** object.


## Remarks

The **Visible** property can only be set to **False** if the **Application**. **[UserControl](Project.Application.UserControl.md)** property is **False** and there are no visible projects. If the **UserControl** property is **True**, the Project application is under user control rather than programmatic control, and the **Visible** property is also **True**.
