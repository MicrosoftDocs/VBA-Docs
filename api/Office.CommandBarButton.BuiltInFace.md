# CommandBarButton.BuiltInFace Property (Office)

Is  **True** if the face of a command bar button control is its original built-in face. Read/write.

> [!NOTE]
> The use of CommandBars in some Microsoft Office applications has been superseded by the new ribbon component of the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface. For more information, search Help for the keyword "ribbon."


## Syntax

 _expression_. `BuiltInFace`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [CommandBarButton](./Office.CommandBarButton.md) object.


## Remarks

This property can only be set to  **True**, which will reset the face to the built-in face. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Example

This example determines whether the face of the first control on the command bar named "Custom" is its built-in button face. If it is, the example copies the button face to the Clipboard.


```vb
Set myControl = CommandBars("My Custom Bar").Controls(1) 
With myControl 
    If .BuiltInFace = True Then .CopyFace 
End With
```
