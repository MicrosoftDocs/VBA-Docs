# Application.Selection property (Excel)

Returns the currently selected object in the active worksheet for an **[Application](Excel.Application(object).md)** object. Returns `Nothing` if no objects are selected. Use the `Select` method to set the selection, and use `TypeName` to discover the kind of object that is selected. 


## Syntax

_expression_. `Selection`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application-graph-property.md) object.


## Remarks

The returned object type depends on the current selection (for example, if a cell is selected, this property returns a  **[Range](Excel.Range(object).md)** object). The **Selection** property returns **Nothing** if nothing is selected.

Using this property with no object qualifier is equivalent to using  `Application.Selection`.


## Example

This example clears the selection on Sheet1 (assuming that the selection is a range of cells).

```vb
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
Selection.Clear
```

This example displays the Visual Basic object type of the selection.

```vb
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
MsgBox "The selection object type is " & TypeName(Selection)
```
This example displays information about the current selection.

```vb
Sub TestSelection(  )
    Dim str As String
    Select Case TypeName(Selection)
    Case "Nothing"
        str = "No selection made."
    Case "Range"
        str = "You selected the range: " & Selection.Address
    Case "Picture"
        str = "You selected a picture."
    Case Else
        str = "You selected a " & TypeName(Selection) & "."
    End Select
    MsgBox str
End Sub
```
