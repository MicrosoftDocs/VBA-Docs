# Chart.ProtectSelection property (Excel)

 **True** if chart elements cannot be selected. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ProtectSelection`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Chart](Excel.Chart-graph-object.md) object.


## Remarks

When this property is  **True** , shapes cannot be added to the chart, and the **Click** and **DoubleClick** events for chart elements don't occur.

This property is not persisted when the file is saved. If you set this property to  **True** and then reopen the file, it will no longer be set to **True**.


## Example

This example prevents chart elements from being selected on embedded chart one on worksheet one.


```vb
Worksheets(1).ChartObjects(1).Chart.ProtectSelection = True
```
