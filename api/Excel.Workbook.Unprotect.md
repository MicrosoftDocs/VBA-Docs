# Workbook.Unprotect Method (Excel)

Removes protection from a sheet or workbook. This method has no effect if the sheet or workbook isn't protected.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Unprotect`( `_Password_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Workbook](./Excel.Workbook.md) object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Password_|Optional| **Variant**|A string that denotes the case-sensitive password to use to unprotect the sheet or workbook. If the sheet or workbook isn't protected with a password, this argument is ignored. If you omit this argument for a sheet that's protected with a password, you'll be prompted for the password. If you omit this argument for a workbook that's protected with a password, the method fails.|
