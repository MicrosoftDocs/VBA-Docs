    strFolderInfo = "The shared workspace contains " &amp; _ 
        ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Folders.Count &amp; " folder(s)." &amp; vbCrLf 
    If ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Folders.Count > 0 Then 
        For Each swsFolder In ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Folders 
            strFolderInfo = strFolderInfo &amp; swsFolder.FolderName &amp; vbCrLf 
        Next 
    End If 
    MsgBox strFolderInfo, vbInformation + vbOKOnly, _ 
        "Folders in Shared Workspace"
