# ContentControl.BuildingBlockCategory property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **String** that represents the category for a building block content control. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `BuildingBlockCategory`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [ContentControl](./Word.ContentControl.md) object.


## Remarks

This property applies only to building block content controls and corresponds with the **Category** option in the **Content Control Properties** dialog box. You can set this property to any string; however, if you set it to a string for which there is no corresponding category, the value of the **Category** option is set to "(All Categories)".


## Example

The following example creates a new building block content control and specifies the type of building block and the gallery.


```vb
Dim objBB As ContentControl 
 
Set objBB = Selection.ContentControls.Add(wdContentControlBuildingBlockGallery) 
 
objBB.BuildingBlockType = wdTypeEquations 
objBB.BuildingBlockCategory = "General"
```
