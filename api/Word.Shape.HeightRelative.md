# Shape.HeightRelative property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the percentage of the relative height of a shape. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `HeightRelative`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **[Shape](Word.Shape.md)** object.


## Remarks

Use this property with the **[RelativeVerticalSize](Word.Shape.RelativeVerticalSize.md)** property. When set to **wdShapeSizeRelativeNone** (-999999) (see the **[WdShapeSizeRelative](Word.WdShapeSizeRelative.md)** enumeration), this property should be ignored because the shape does not use percent sizing. The height is solely determined by the **[Height](Word.Shape.Height.md)** property.
