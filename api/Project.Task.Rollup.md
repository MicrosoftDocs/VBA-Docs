# Task.Rollup property (Project)

 **True** if the dates of a subtask appear on its corresponding summary task bar. Read/write **Variant**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Rollup`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Task](./Project.Task.md) object.


## Remarks

The **Rollup** property must be **True** on the summary task as well as the subtasks for the rollup to occur.


## Example

The following example sets the **Rollup** property to **True** for milestone tasks, and to **False** for other tasks in the active project.


```vb
Sub DisplayMilestonesInSummaryBars() 
 
 Dim T As Task ' Task object used in For Each loop 
 
 ' Cycle through tasks in active project. 
 For Each T In ActiveProject.Tasks 
 ' If task is a milestone or a summary, set its Rollup property to True. 
 If T.Summary Or T.Milestone Then 
 T.Rollup = True 
 ' If task isn't a summary task or milestone, set its Rollup property to False. 
 Else 
 T.Rollup = False 
 End If 
 Next T 
 
End Sub
```
