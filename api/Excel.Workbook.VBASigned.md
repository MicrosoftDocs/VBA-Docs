# Workbook.VBASigned property (Excel)

 **True** if the Visual Basic for Applications project for the specified workbook has been digitally signed. Read-only **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `VBASigned`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Workbook](./Excel.Workbook.md) object.


## Example

```vb
Workbooks.Open FileName:="c:\My Documents\mybook.xls", _ 
 ReadOnly:=False 
If Workbook.VBASigned = False Then 
 MsgBox "Warning! The project " _ & 
 "has not been digitally signed." _ & 
 , vbCritical, "Digital Signature Warning" 
End If
```
