# XlTrendlineType Enumeration (PowerPoint)

Specifies how the trendline that smoothes out fluctuations in the data is calculated.



|Name|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**xlExponential**|5|Uses an equation to calculate the least squares fit through points (for example, y=ab^x) .|
|**xlLinear**|-4132|Uses the linear equation y = mx + b to calculate the least squares fit through points.|
|**xlLogarithmic**|-4133|Uses the equation y = c ln x + b to calculate the least squares fit through points.|
|**xlMovingAvg**|6|Uses a sequence of averages computed from parts of the data series. The number of points equals the total number of points in the series minus the number specified for the period.|
|**xlPolynomial**|3|Uses an equation to calculate the least squares fit through points (for example, y = ax^6 + bx^5 + cx^4 + dx^3 + ex^2 + fx + g).|
|**xlPower**|4|Uses an equation to calculate the least squares fit through points (for example, y = ax^b).|
