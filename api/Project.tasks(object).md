# Tasks object (Project)

Contains a collection of  **[Task](Project.Task.md)** objects.


## Example

 **Using the Task Object**

Use  **Tasks** (_index_), where _index_ is the task index number or task name, to return a single **Task** object. The following example prints the names of every resource assigned to every task in the active project.




```vb
Dim Temp As Long, A As Assignment 

Dim TaskName As String, Assigned As String, Results As String 

 

For Temp = 1 To ActiveProject.Tasks.Count 

 TaskName = "Task: " & ActiveProject.Tasks(Temp).Name & vbCrLf 

 For Each A In ActiveProject.Tasks(Temp).Assignments 

 Assigned = A.ResourceName & ListSeparator & " " & Assigned 

 Next A 

 Results = Results & TaskName & "Resources: " & _ 

 Left$(Assigned, Len(Assigned) - Len(ListSeparator & " ")) & vbCrLf & vbCrLf 

 TaskName = "" 

 Assigned = "" 

Next Temp 

 

MsgBox Results
```

Use the **[Tasks](./Project.Selection.Tasks.md)** property to return a **Tasks** collection. The following example displays the name of every task in the selection.




```vb
Dim T As Task, Names As String 

 

For Each T In ActiveSelection.Tasks 

 Names = Names & T.Name & vbCrLf 

Next T 

 

MsgBox Names
```

Use the **[Add](./Project.Tasks.Add.md)** method to add a **Task** object to the **Tasks** collection. The following example adds a new task to the end of the task list.




```vb
ActiveProject.Tasks.Add "Hang clocks"
```
