# ToOrFromRuleCondition Object (Outlook)

Represents a rule condition that the sender or the recipeints of the message, as specified by  **[ToOrFromRuleCondition.ConditionType](Outlook.ToOrFromRuleCondition.ConditionType.md)**, is in the recipients list specified in **[ToOrFromRuleCondition.Recipients](Outlook.ToOrFromRuleCondition.Recipients.md)**.


## Remarks

 **ToOrFromRuleCondition** is derived from the **[RuleCondition](Outlook.RuleCondition.md)** object. Each rule is associated with a **[RuleConditions](Outlook.RuleConditions.md)** object which has a **[SentTo](Outlook.RuleConditions.SentTo.md)** property and a **[From](Outlook.RuleConditions.From.md)**. Each of these properties always returns a **ToOrFromRuleCondition** object. **ToOrFromRuleCondition.ConditionType** distinguishes between these rule conditions. If the rule has any of these rule conditions enabled, then **[ToOrFromRuleCondition.Enabled](Outlook.ToOrFromRuleCondition.Enabled.md)** would be **True**.

For more information on specifying rule conditions, see [Specify Rule Conditions](../outlook/How-to/Rules/specifying-rule-conditions.md).
