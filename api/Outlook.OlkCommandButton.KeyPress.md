An ANSI key is one that produces a typeable character when the user presses it. The **KeyPress** event occurs when the user presses an ANSI key on a running form while the form or a control on it has the focus. The event can occur either before or after the key is released.

A **KeyPress** event does not occur under the following conditions:


- Pressing  **TAB**
    
- Pressing  **ENTER**
    
- Pressing an arrow key
    
- When a keystroke causes the focus to move from one control to another.
