| _Arg3_|Required| **Double**|Nper - the total number of payment periods in an annuity.|
| _Arg4_|Required| **Double**|Pv - the present value ? the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now.|
| _Arg5_|Optional| **Variant**|Fv - the future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (zero), that is, the future value of a loan is 0.|

Make sure that you are consistent about the units you use for specifying rate and nper. If you make monthly payments on a four-year loan at 12 percent annual interest, use 12%/12 for rate and 4*12 for nper. If you make annual payments on the same loan, use 12% for rate and 4 for nper.
