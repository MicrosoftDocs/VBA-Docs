# OptionButton.AutoSize Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a **Boolean** that specifies whether an object automatically resizes to display its entire contents. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**AutoSize**

_expression_ A variable that represents an **OptionButton** object.


## Remarks

 **True** to automatically resize the control to display its entire contents. **False** to keep the size of the control constant; contents are clipped when they exceed the area of the control (default).

For controls with captions, the  **AutoSize** property specifies whether the control automatically adjusts to display the entire caption.

If you manually change the size of a control while  **AutoSize** is **True**, the manual change overrides the size previously set by  **AutoSize**.
