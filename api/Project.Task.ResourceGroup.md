# Task.ResourceGroup property (Project)

Gets the names of groups associated with the resources assigned to a task, separated by the list separator. Read-only  **String**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ResourceGroup`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Task](./Project.Task.md) object.


## Remarks

For example, if Bob's group is "Writers" and Greg's group is "Editors", and Greg and Bob are assigned to the same task, then the **ResourceGroup** property for that task returns "Writers,Editors". This example assumes that the list separator character is the comma (,). The list separator character can be set with the **ListSeparator** property.
