# TableOfAuthorities.IncludeSequenceName property (Word)

## Syntax

 _expression_. `IncludeSequenceName`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a '[TableOfAuthorities](Word.TableOfAuthorities.md)' object.

## Example

This example inserts a table of authorities at the beginning of the active document and then formats the table to include the Chapter sequence field number before the page number (for example, "Chapter 2-14").


```vb
Dim rngTemp As Range 
Dim toaTemp As TableOfAuthorities 
 
Set rngTemp = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=0, End:=0) 
Set toaTemp = _ 
 ActiveDocument.TablesOfAuthorities.Add(Range:=rngTemp) 
 
toaTemp.IncludeSequenceName = "Chapter"
```

This example returns the sequence name for the first table of authorities.




```vb
Dim strSequence As String 
 
strSequence = _ 
 ActiveDocument.TablesOfAuthorities(1).IncludeSequenceName
```
