# Selection.ClearParagraphDirectFormatting method (Word)

Removes paragraph formatting that has been applied manually (using the buttons on the ribbon or through the dialog boxes) from the selected text.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ClearParagraphDirectFormatting`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **[Selection](Word.Selection.md)** object.


## Remarks

This method does not remove paragraph formatting that has been applied by using a paragraph style. To remove paragraph formatting that the user has applied by using paragraph styles, use the **[ClearParagraphStyle](Word.Selection.ClearParagraphStyle.md)** method. To remove all paragraph formatting, both style and manual formatting, use the **[ClearParagraphAllFormatting](Word.Selection.ClearParagraphAllFormatting.md)** method.


> [!NOTE] 
> For more information about how to remove character formatting, see the **[ClearCharacterAllFormatting](Word.Selection.ClearCharacterAllFormatting.md)**, **[ClearCharacterDirectFormatting](Word.Selection.ClearCharacterDirectFormatting.md)**, or **[ClearCharacterStyle](Word.Selection.ClearCharacterStyle.md)** method.
