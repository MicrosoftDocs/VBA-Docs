# EmailMergeEnvelope.To Property (Publisher)

Gets or sets the  **MailMergeDataField** object that represents the data-source field (column) that lists the email addresses of recipients of the merged email message. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **To**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an  **EmailMergeEnvelope** object.

## Remarks

You must make certain that you assign the correct data-source field (the one that represents email addresses) to the  **To** property. You can use the following line of code, which gets the value of the **Name** property of the **MailMergeDataField** object to which **To** is assigned, to ensure that you make the correct assignment:


```vb
Debug.Print ThisDocument.MailMerge.EmailMergeEnvelope.To.Name
```

For an example of how to set the  **To** property value, see the **[EmailMergeEnvelope](Publisher.EmailMergeEnvelope.md)** object topic.
