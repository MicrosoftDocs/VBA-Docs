Sub CreateAndApplyHighestPriorityFilter() 
    Dim TaskFilter As Variant  ' Index for For Each loop. 
    Dim Found As Boolean    ' Whether or not the filter exists. 
    Found = False   ' Assume the filter does not exist. 
    ' Look for filter. 
    For Each TaskFilter In ActiveProject.TaskFilterList 
        If TaskFilter = "Highest Priority" Then 
            Found = True 
            Exit For 
        End If 
    Next TaskFilter 
 
    ' If filter doesn't exist, create it. 
    If Not Found Then FilterEdit Name:="Highest Priority", _ 
        Create:=True, TaskFilter:=True, FieldName:="Priority", _ 
        Test:="equals", Value:="Highest"
