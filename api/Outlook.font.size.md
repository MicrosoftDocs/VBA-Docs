# Font.Size Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a  **Currency** that indicates the height, in [points](../language/glossary/vbe-glossary.md#point), of displayed text. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_ A variable that represents a  **Font** object.


## Remarks

The font's appearance on screen and in print may differ, depending on your computer and printer. If you select a font that your system can't display with the specified attribute or that isn't installed, Windows substitutes a similar font. The substitute font will be as similar as possible to the font originally requested.

The default point size is determined by the operating system.
