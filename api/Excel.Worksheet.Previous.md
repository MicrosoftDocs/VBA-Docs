# Worksheet.Previous property (Excel)

Returns a  **[Worksheet](Excel.Worksheet.md)** object that represents the next sheet.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Previous`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Worksheet](./Excel.Worksheet.md) object.


## Remarks

If the object is a range, this property emulates pressing SHIFT+TAB; unlike the key combination, however, the property returns the previous cell without selecting it.

On a protected sheet, this property returns the previous unlocked cell. On an unprotected sheet, this property always returns the cell immediately to the left of the specified cell.


## Example

This example selects the previous unlocked cell on Sheet1. If Sheet1 is unprotected, this is the cell immediately to the left of the active cell.


```vb
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
ActiveCell.Previous.Select
```
