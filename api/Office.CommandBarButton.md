# CommandBarButton object (Office)

Represents a button control on a command bar.

> [!NOTE]
> The use of CommandBars in some Microsoft Office applications has been superseded by the new ribbon component of the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface. For more information, see [Overview of the Office Fluent ribbon](../library-reference/concepts/overview-of-the-office-fluent-ribbon.md).


## Example

Use **Controls(_index_)**, where _index_ is the index number of the control, to return a **CommandBarButton** object. Note that the **Type** property of the control must be **[msoControlButton](office.msocontroltype.md)**. Assuming that the second control on the command bar named **Custom** is a button, the following example changes the style of that button.


```vb
Set c = CommandBars("Custom").Controls(2) 
With c 
If .Type = msoControlButton Then 
    If .Style = msoButtonIcon Then 
        .Style = msoButtonIconAndCaption 
    Else 
        .Style = msoButtonIcon 
    End If 
End If 
End With
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the **FindControl** method to return a **CommandBarButton** object.
