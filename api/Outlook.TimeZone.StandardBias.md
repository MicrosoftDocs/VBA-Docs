# TimeZone.StandardBias property (Outlook)

Returns a **Long** value that represents the time offset in minutes from the **[Bias](Outlook.TimeZone.Bias.md)** to account for standard time in this time zone. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `StandardBias`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [TimeZone](Outlook.TimeZone.md) object.


## Remarks

This value is stored as part of the value for  **TZI** for the time zone in the Windows registry. The **TZI** value is mapped to the Windows **[TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION](overview/Outlook.md)** structure.

In relation to the UTC time and the local time of the time zone, UTC time is the result of adding the  **Bias** and **StandardBias** to the local time. For example, in a state adopting standard time in the Pacific time zone, the **Bias** is 480 minutes and **StandardBias** is 0 minutes. To determine the time in UTC for June 11, 2 A.M. PST, add a **Bias** of (480/60) hours and a **StandardBias** of 0 hours to the local time June 11, 2 A.M. The time in UTC is June 11, 10 A.M.
