# DataColumn.Visible Property (Visio)

Specifies whether the data column appears on the tab for its parent data recordset in the  **External Data** window in the Microsoft Visio user interface. Read/write.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Visible`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [DataColumn](./Visio.DataColumn.md) object.


## Return value

Boolean


## Remarks

If when a shape is linked to data,  **Visible** is set to **True** , and if Visio adds a row to the Shape Data section of the ShapeSheet spreadsheet of the linked shape for the data column, subsequently setting the **Visible** property to **False** causes Visio to remove the ShapeSheet row it added.

If the row in the Shape Data section existed prior to linking, setting the  **Visible** property to **False** does not result in Visio removing the ShapeSheet row; however, the shape data item the row represents no longer is subject to change when data in the data recordset is refreshed.

When the  **Visible** property is set to **False** , Visio does not create a ShapeSheet row for the data column when it links shapes to data.
