# SeriesLines Property

Returns a  **[SeriesLines](Excel.SeriesLines-graph-object.md)** object that represents the series lines for the specified stacked bar chart or stacked column chart. Applies only to stacked bar and stacked column charts. Read-only.


## Example

```vb
With myChart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasSeriesLines = True 
 With .SeriesLines.Border 
 .LineStyle = xlThin 
 .Weight = xlMedium 
 .ColorIndex = 3 
 End With 
End With
