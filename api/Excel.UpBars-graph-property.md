# UpBars Property

Returns an  **[UpBars](Excel.UpBars-graph-object.md)** object that represents the up bars on a line chart. Applies only to line charts. Read-only.


## Example

This example turns on up and down bars for chart group one and then sets their colors. The example should be run on a 2-D line chart containing two series that cross each other at one or more data points.


```vb
With myChart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasUpDownBars = True 
 .DownBars.Interior.ColorIndex = 3 
 .UpBars.Interior.ColorIndex = 5 
End With
```
