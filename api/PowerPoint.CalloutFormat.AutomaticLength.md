# CalloutFormat.AutomaticLength Method (PowerPoint)

Specifies that the first segment of the callout line (the segment attached to the text callout box) be scaled automatically when the callout is moved. Use the  **[CustomLength](PowerPoint.CalloutFormat.CustomLength.md)** method to specify that the first segment of the callout line retain the fixed length returned by the **Length** property whenever the callout is moved. Applies only to callouts whose lines consist of more than one segment (types **msoCalloutThree** and **msoCalloutFour**).


## Syntax

 _expression_. `AutomaticLength`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [CalloutFormat](./PowerPoint.CalloutFormat.md) object.


## Remarks

Applying this method sets the [AutoLength](PowerPoint.CalloutFormat.AutoLength.md)property to  **True**.


## Example

This example switches between an automatically scaling first segment and one with a fixed length for the callout line for shape one on  `myDocument`. For the example to work, shape one must be a callout.


```vb
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes(1).Callout

    If .AutoLength Then

        .CustomLength 50

    Else

        .AutomaticLength

    End If

End With
```
