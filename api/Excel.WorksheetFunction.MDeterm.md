# WorksheetFunction.MDeterm Method (Excel)

Returns the matrix determinant of an array.

## Syntax

_expression_. `MDeterm`(`Arg1`)

_expression_ A variable that represents a [WorksheetFunction](./Excel.WorksheetFunction.md) object.


### Parameters

|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Arg1_|Required| **Variant**|Array - a numeric array with an equal number of rows and columns.|

### Return value

Double


## Remarks

- Array can be given as a cell range, for example, A1:C3; as an array constant, such as {1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9}; or as a name to either of these. 
    
- MDTERM returns the #VALUE! error when:
    
  - Any cells in array are empty or contain text.
    
  - Array does not have an equal number of rows and columns.
    
  - The size of array exceeds 73 columns by 73 rows.
    
- The matrix determinant is a number derived from the values in array. For a three-row, three-column array, A1:C3, the determinant is defined as: `MDETERM(A1:C3)` equals `A1*(B2*C3-B3*C2) + A2*(B3*C1-B1*C3) + A3*(B1*C2-B2*C1)`
    
- Matrix determinants are generally used for solving systems of mathematical equations that involve several variables.
    
- MDETERM is calculated with an accuracy of approximately 16 digits, which may lead to a small numeric error when the calculation is not complete. For example, the determinant of a singular matrix may differ from zero by 1E-16.
