## Example

This example selects the first shape in the canvas, and if the selected shape is a child shape, fills the shape with the specified color. This example assumes that the first shape in the active presentation is a drawing canvas that contains multiple shapes.


```vb
Sub FillChildShape()



    'Select the first shape in the drawing canvas

    ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1).CanvasItems(1).Select



    'Fill selected shape if it is a child shape

    With ActiveWindow.Selection



        If .ShapeRange.Child = msoTrue Then

            .ShapeRange.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(Red:=100, Green:=0, Blue:=200)

        Else

            MsgBox "This shape is not a child shape."

        End If



    End With



End Sub
```
