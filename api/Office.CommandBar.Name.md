# CommandBar.Name property (Office)

Gets the name of the built-in **CommandBar** object. Read-only.

> [!NOTE]
> The use of CommandBars in some Microsoft Office applications has been superseded by the new ribbon component of the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface. For more information, see [Overview of the Office Fluent ribbon](../library-reference/concepts/overview-of-the-office-fluent-ribbon.md).


## Syntax

_expression_.**Name**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[CommandBar](Office.CommandBar.md)** object.


## Remarks

The local name of a built-in command bar is displayed in the title bar (when the command bar isn't docked) and in the list of available command barsâ€”wherever that list is displayed in the container application. For a built-in command bar, the **Name** property returns the command bar's U.S. English name. Use the **NameLocal** property to return the localized name. If you change the value of the **LocalName** property for a custom command bar, the value of **Name** changes as well, and vice versa.


## Example

This example searches the collection of command bars for the command bar named **Custom**. If this command bar is found, the example makes it visible.


```vb
foundFlag =  False 
For Each bar In CommandBars 
    If bar.Name = "Custom" Then 
        foundFlag = True  
        bar.Visible = True  
    End If 
Next 
If Not foundFlag Then 
    MsgBox "'Custom' bar isn't in collection." 
Else 
    MsgBox "'Custom' bar is now visible." 
End If
```
