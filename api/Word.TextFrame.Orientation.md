# TextFrame.Orientation property (Word)

Returns or sets the orientation of the text inside the frame. Read/write  **MsoTextOrientation**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Orientation**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[TextFrame](Word.TextFrame.md)** object.


## Remarks

Some of the **MsoTextOrientation** constants may not be available to you, depending on the language support (U.S. English, for example) that you have selected or installed.

You can set the orientation for a text frame or for a range or selection that happens to occur inside a text frame. For information about the difference between a text frame and a text box, see the **TextFrame** object.


## Example

This example creates a new document, inserts text into it, uses this text to create a text box, and then sets the orientation of the text frame so that the text slopes upward.


```vb
Set mydoc = Documents.Add 
Selection.TypeText "This is some text." 
mydoc.Content.Select 
Selection.CreateTextbox 
mydoc.Shapes(1).TextFrame.Orientation = msoTextOrientationUpward
```
