# Workbook.ChangeFileAccess method (Excel)

Changes the access permissions for the workbook. This may require an updated version to be loaded from the disk.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ChangeFileAccess`( `_Mode_` , `_WritePassword_` , `_Notify_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Workbook](./Excel.Workbook.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Mode_|Required| **[xlFileAccess](Excel.XlFileAccess.md)**|Specifies the new access mode.|
| _WritePassword_|Optional| **Variant**|Specifies the write-reserved password if the file is write reserved and  _Mode_ is **xlReadWrite**. Ignored if there's no password for the file or if _Mode_ is **xlReadOnly**.|
| _Notify_|Optional| **Variant**| **True** (or omitted) to notify the user if the file cannot be immediately accessed.|

## Remarks

If you have a file open in read-only mode, you don't have exclusive access to the file. If you change a file from read-only to read/write, Microsoft Excel must load a new copy of the file to ensure that no changes were made while you had the file open as read-only.


## Example

This example sets the active workbook to read-only.


```vb
ActiveWorkbook.ChangeFileAccess Mode:=xlReadOnly
```
