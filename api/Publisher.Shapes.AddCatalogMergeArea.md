# Shapes.AddCatalogMergeArea Method (Publisher)

Adds a  **Shape** object that represents the specified publication's catalog merge area.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AddCatalogMergeArea**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **Shapes** object.


### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks

Only one catalog merge area can be added to a publication page. Typically, a publication will only have one catalog merge area.

Although you can add one catalog merge area per publication page, you can only connect to a single data source for a publication. What data is merged is determined by the catalog merge area on the active page, and the data fields it contains.

> [!NOTE] 
> You must add a catalog merge area to the publication page before you connect to a data source.

Use the  **[AddToCatalogMergeArea](Publisher.Shape.AddToCatalogMergeArea.md)** method of the **[Shape](Publisher.Shape.md)** or **[ShapeRange](Publisher.ShapeRange.md)** objects to add shapes to a catalog merge area.

Use the  **[Insert](Publisher.MailMergeDataField.Insert.md)** method of the **[MailMergeDataFields](Publisher.MailMergeDataFields.md)** collection to add a picture data field to a publication's catalog merge area.

Use the  **[InsertMailMergeField](Publisher.TextRange.InsertMailMergeField.md)** method of the **[TextRange](Publisher.TextRange.md)** object to add a text data field to a text box in the publication's catalog merge area.

Use the  **[RemoveCatalogMergeArea](Publisher.Shape.RemoveCatalogMergeArea.md)** method of the **[Shape](Publisher.Shape.md)** object to remove a catalog merge area from a publication.

This method corresponds to selecting a catalog merge in  **Step 1: Select a merge type** of the **Mail and Catalog Merge Wizard**.


## Example

The following example adds a catalog merge area to the first page of the specified publication.


```vb
ThisDocument.Pages(1).Shapes.AddCatalogMergeArea
```
