## Example

This example displays a message when a user moves from step three of the Mail Merge Wizard to step four.

This example assumes that you have declared an application variable called MailMergeApp in your general declarations and have set the variable equal to the Word Application object.


```vb
Private Sub MailMergeApp_MailMergeWizardStateChange(ByVal Doc As Document, _ 
 FromState As Long, ToState As Long, Handled As Boolean) 
 
 Dim intVBAnswer As Integer 
 FromState = 3 
 ToState = 4 
 
 'Display a message when moving from step three to step four 
 intVBAnswer = MsgBox("Have you selected all of your recipients?", _ 
 vbYesNo, "Wizard State Event!") 
 
 If intVBAnswer = vbYes Then 
 'Continue on to step four 
 Handled = True 
 Else 
 'Return to step three 
 MsgBox "Please select all recipients to whom " & _ 
 "you want to send this letter." 
 Handled = False 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
