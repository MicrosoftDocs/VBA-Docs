# ShapeRange.RerouteConnections method (Project)
The **RerouteConnections** method is not implemented in Project.

## Syntax

_expression_.**RerouteConnections**

_expression_ A variable that represents a 'ShapeRange' object.


## Return value

 **Nothing**


## Remarks

In general for applications that implement Office Art, the **RerouteConnections** method changes the routing of a connector to the shortest path between the shapes it connects. Project does not support the connect and disconnect methods of the **ConnectorFormat** object, and so it does not support **RerouteConnections**. For more information, see the **[ConnectorFormat](Project.shaperange.connectorformat.md)** property.
