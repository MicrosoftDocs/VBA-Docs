# Cell.VerticalAlignment property (Word)

Returns or sets the vertical alignment of text in one or more cells of a table. Read/write  **WdCellVerticalAlignment**.


## Syntax

```vb
Set newDoc = Documents.Add 
Set myTable = newDoc.Tables.Add(Selection.Range, 3, 3) 
i = 1 
For Each c In myTable.Range.Cells 
 c.Range.InsertAfter "Cell " & i 
 i = i + 1 
Next 
With myTable.Rows(1) 
 .Height = 20 
 .Cells.VerticalAlignment = wdAlignVerticalTop 
End With
```
