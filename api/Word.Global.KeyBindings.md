# Global.KeyBindings property (Word)

## Syntax

_expression_. `KeyBindings`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Global](Word.Global.md)' object.


## Example

CustomizationContext = NormalTemplate 
KeyBindings.Add KeyCode:=BuildKeyCode(wdKeyControl, wdKeyAlt, _

```

This example inserts the command name and key combination string for each item in the **KeyBindings** collection.




```vb
Dim kbLoop As KeyBinding 
 
CustomizationContext = NormalTemplate 
For Each kbLoop In KeyBindings 
 Selection.InsertAfter kbLoop.Command & vbTab _ 
 & kbLoop.KeyString & vbCr 
 Selection.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd 
Next kbLoop
```
