# ListBox.Value property (Access)

Determines or specifies which value or option in the list box is selected. Read/write **Variant**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Value**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[ListBox](Access.ListBox.md)** object.


## Remarks

Sets the **Value** property to the value in the bound column for the item selected in the list.

The **Value** property returns or sets a control's default property, which is the property that is assumed when you don't explicitly specify a property name.

> [!NOTE] 
> The **Value** property is not the same as the **DefaultValue** property, which specifies the value that a property is assigned when a new record is created.
