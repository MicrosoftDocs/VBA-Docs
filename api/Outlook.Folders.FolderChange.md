# Folders.FolderChange event (Outlook)

Occurs when a folder in the specified  **[Folders](Outlook.Folders.md)** collection is changed.


## Syntax

_expression_. `FolderChange`( `_Folder_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Folders](Outlook.Folders.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Folder_|Required| **[Folder](Outlook.Folder.md)**|The folder that has been changed.|

## Remarks

The **FolderChange** event fires when a folder in a **Folders** collection object is changed, either through user action or program code. The change can be a user or program code renaming the folder, or adding, changing, or removing an item in the folder. This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).


## Example

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example prompts the user to remove a folder from the  **Deleted Items** folder if the folder is empty. The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```vb
Dim WithEvents myFolders As Outlook.Folders 
 
 
 
Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myNS = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set myFolders = myNS.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderDeletedItems).Folders 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myFolders_FolderChange(ByVal Folder As Outlook.Folder) 
 
 If Folder.Items.Count = 0 Then 
 
 MyPrompt = Folder.Name & " is empty. Do you want to delete it?" 
 
 If MsgBox(MyPrompt, vbYesNo + vbQuestion) = vbYes Then 
 
 Folder.Delete 
 
 End If 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
