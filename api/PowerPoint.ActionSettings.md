# ActionSettings Object (PowerPoint)

A collection that contains the two  **[ActionSetting](PowerPoint.ActionSetting.md)** objects for a shape or text range. One **ActionSetting** object represents how the specified object reacts when the user clicks it during a slide show, and the other **ActionSetting** object represents how the specified object reacts when the user moves the mouse pointer over it during a slide show.


## Example

Use the [ActionSettings](PowerPoint.Shape.ActionSettings.md)property to return the  **ActionSettings** collection. Use **ActionSettings** (index), where index is either **ppMouseClick** or **ppMouseOver**, to return a single **ActionSetting** object. The following example specifies that the CalculateTotal macro be run whenever the mouse pointer passes over the shape during a slide show.


```vb
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(3) _
        .ActionSettings(ppMouseOver)
    .Action = ppActionRunMacro
    .Run = "CalculateTotal"
    .AnimateAction = True
End With
```
