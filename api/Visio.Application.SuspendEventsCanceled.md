# Application.SuspendEventsCanceled Event (Visio)

Occurs after an event handler has returned  **True** (cancel) to a **QueryCancelSuspendEvents** event. .


## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression_ _'SuspendEventsCanceled'(**_ByVal app As_**)

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [Application](./Visio.Application.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _app_|Required| **[IVAPPLICATION]**|The instance of Microsoft Visio in which firing of events was going to be suspended.|

## Remarks

If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event codes](../visio/Concepts/event-codesvisio.md).
