 'Creates a new document with a five-row by five-column table 
 Set pgeNew = ActiveDocument.Pages.Add(Count:=1, After:=1) 
 Set shpTable = pgeNew.Shapes.AddTable(NumRows:=5, NumColumns:=5, _ 
 Left:=72, Top:=72, Width:=468, Height:=100) 
 Set tblNew = shpTable.Table 
 
 'Inserts a diagonal split into all cells in even-numbered columns 
 For Each rowTable In tblNew.Rows

 If celTable.Column Mod 2 = 0 Then
