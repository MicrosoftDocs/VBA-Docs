# WorksheetFunction.Ispmt method (Excel)

Calculates the interest paid during a specific period of an investment. This function is provided for compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Ispmt`( `_Arg1_` , `_Arg2_` , `_Arg3_` , `_Arg4_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [WorksheetFunction](./Excel.WorksheetFunction.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Arg1_|Required| **Double**|Rate - the interest rate for the investment.|
| _Arg2_|Required| **Double**|Per - the period for which you want to find the interest, and must be between 1 and nper.|
| _Arg3_|Required| **Double**|Nper - the total number of payment periods for the investment.|
| _Arg4_|Required| **Double**|Pv - the present value of the investment. For a loan, pv is the loan amount.|

## Return value

Double


## Remarks




- Make sure that you are consistent about the units you use for specifying rate and nper. If you make monthly payments on a four-year loan at an annual interest rate of 12 percent, use 12%/12 for rate and 4*12 for nper. If you make annual payments on the same loan, use 12% for rate and 4 for nper.
    
- For all the arguments, the cash you pay out, such as deposits to savings or other withdrawals, is represented by negative numbers; the cash you receive, such as dividend checks and other deposits, is represented by positive numbers.
    
- For additional information about financial functions, see the PV function.
