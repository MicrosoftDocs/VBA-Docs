# ListBox.Selected Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a **Boolean** that indicates the selection state of items in a **[ListBox](Outlook.listbox.md)**. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Selected**(**_pvargIndex_**)

_expression_ A variable that represents a **ListBox** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|pvargIndex|Required| **Variant**|An integer with a range from 0 to one less than the number of items in the list.|

## Remarks

 **True** to indicate that the specified item is selected, **False** if it is not selected.

The **Selected** property is useful when users can make multiple selections. You can use this property to determine the selected rows in a multi-select list box. You can also use this property to select or deselect rows in a list from code.

The default value of this property is based on the current selection state of the  **ListBox**.

For single-selection list boxes, the  **[Value](Outlook.listbox.value.md)** or **[ListIndex](Outlook.listbox.listindex.md)** properties are recommended for getting and setting the selection. In this case, **ListIndex** returns the index of the selected item. However, in a multiple selection, **ListIndex** returns the index of the row contained within the focus rectangle, regardless of whether the row is actually selected.

When a list box control's  **[MultiSelect](Outlook.listbox.multiselect.md)** property is set to 0, only one row can have its **Selected** property set to **True**.

Entering a value that is out of range for the index does not generate an error message, but does not set a property for any item in the list.
