## Syntax

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Application](Project.Application.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|

| _Label_|Required|**String**|Name that appears in the drop-down list for the **Undo Transaction** command.|
| _guid_|Optional|**Variant**|GUID that uniquely identifies Label.|

## Remarks

You cannot nest one undo transaction within another.


## Example

The following example demonstrates using the **OpenUndoTransaction** method to create an undo transaction set. After you run the macro, the task named **Task outside transaction** shows as the item **Insert Task** in the **Undo** drop-down list on the **Quick Access Toolbar**. The six tasks named  **UndoMe 1** to **UndoMe 6** show as **Create 6 tasks** in the **Undo** list.


```vb
Sub CreateTasksWithUndoTransaction() 
    ActiveProject.Tasks.Add "Task outside transaction" 
    Application.OpenUndoTransaction "Create 6 tasks" 
    Dim i As Integer 
    For i = 1 To 6 
        ActiveProject.Tasks.Add "UndoMe " & i 
    Next 
    Application.CloseUndoTransaction  
End Sub
```
