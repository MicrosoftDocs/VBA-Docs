# CommandButton Object (Outlook Forms Script)

Starts, ends, or interrupts an action or series of actions.


## Remarks

The macro or event procedure assigned to the  **CommandButton** control's **[Click](Outlook.commandbutton.click.md)** event determines what the **CommandButton** does. For example, you can create a **CommandButton** that opens another form. You can also display text, a picture, or both on a **CommandButton**.

The only event for a  **CommandButton** is the **Click** event.
