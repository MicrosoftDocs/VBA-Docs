# Chart Control

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You can use the chart control to embed a chart that displays Microsoft Access data from a form or report. You can then edit the chart by using Microsoft Graph from within the form or report.


## Remarks

When you place a chart control on a form or report, Microsoft Access displays the Chart Wizard to help you create the chart.

> [!NOTE] 
> To embed or link a chart containing data from other applications, use an [unbound object frame](unbound-object-frame-control.md) or [bound object frame](bound-object-frame-control.md) control.
