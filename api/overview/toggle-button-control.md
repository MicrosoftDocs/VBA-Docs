# Toggle Button Control

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

A toggle button on a form is a stand-alone control used to display a Yes/No value from an underlying record source.

## Remarks

When you click a toggle button that's bound to a Yes/No field, Microsoft Access displays the value in the underlying table according to the field's  **[Format](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/9bb18f6a-0a25-9bbf-88ba-adf603c11826%28Office.15%29.aspx)** property (Yes/No, **True** / **False**, or On/Off).

Toggle buttons are most useful when used in an option group with other buttons.

You can also use a toggle button in a custom dialog box to accept user input.
