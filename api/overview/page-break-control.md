# Page Break Control

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The page break control marks the start of a new screen or printed page on a form or report.


## Remarks

In a form, a page break is active only when you set the form's  **DefaultView** property to Single Form. Page breaks don't affect a form's datasheet.

In Form view, press the PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN key to move to the previous or next page break.

Position page breaks above or below other controls. Placing a page break on the same line as another control splits that control's data.
