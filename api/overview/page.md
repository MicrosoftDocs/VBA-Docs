# Page

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

A **Page** object corresponds to an individual page on a tab control.

Each **Page** object can contain one or more controls, such as text boxes or option buttons. Controls on a **Page** object belong to that **Page** object's **Controls** collection. In order to work with a control on a **Page** object, you must refer to that control within the **Page** object's **Control** collection.
With the tab control, you can construct a single form or dialog box that contains several different tabs, and you can group similar options or data on each tab's page. For example, you might use a tab control on an Employees form to separate general and personal information.
