# FileDialog members (Office)

Provides file dialog box functionality similar to the functionality of the standard **Open** and **Save** dialog boxes found in Microsoft Office applications.


## Methods

|Name|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Execute](../../Office.FileDialog.Execute.md)|Carries out a user's action right after the **Show** method is invoked.|
|[Show](../../Office.FileDialog.Show.md)|Displays a file dialog box and returns a **Long** indicating whether the user pressed the **Action** button (-1) or the **Cancel** button (0). When you call the **Show** method, no more code executes until the user dismisses the file dialog box. In the case of **Open** and **SaveAs** dialog boxes, use the **Execute** method right after the **Show** method to carry out the user's action.|
