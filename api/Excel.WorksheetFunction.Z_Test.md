# WorksheetFunction.Z_Test method (Excel)

Returns the one-tailed probability-value of a z-test. For a given hypothesized population mean, Z_TEST returns the probability that the sample mean would be greater than the average of observations in the data set (array) ? that is, the observed sample mean.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Z_Test`( `_Arg1_` , `_Arg2_` , `_Arg3_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[WorksheetFunction](Excel.WorksheetFunction.md)' object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Arg1_|Required| **Variant**|Array is the array or range of data against which to test the hypothesized population mean.|
| _Arg2_|Required| **Double**|The value to test.|
| _Arg3_|Optional| **Variant**|Sigma - The population (known) standard deviation. If omitted, the sample standard deviation is used.|

## Return value

Double


## Remarks




- If array is empty, Z_TEST returns the #N/A error value.
    
- Z_TEST is calculated as follows when sigma is not omitted:
![The Z_TEST calculation when sigma is not omitted](../images/Z_TEST_SIGMA_ZA10391001.jpg)or when sigma is omitted: 
![The Z_TEST calculation when sigma is omitted](../images/Z_TEST_ZA10391000.jpg)where x is the sample mean AVERAGE(array); s is the sample standard deviation STDEV_S(array); and n is the number of observations in the sample COUNT(array). 
    
- Z_TEST represents the probability that the sample mean would be greater than the observed value AVERAGE(array), when the underlying population mean is ? 0 . From the symmetry of the Normal distribution, if AVERAGE(array) < ?0 , Z_TEST will return a value greater than 0.5.
    
- The following Excel formula can be used to calculate the two-tailed probability that the sample mean would be further from ? 0 (in either direction) than AVERAGE(array), when the underlying population mean is ?0 : =2 * MIN(Z_TEST(array,?0 ,sigma), 1 - Z_TEST(array,?0 ,sigma)).
