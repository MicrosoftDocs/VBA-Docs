# ChartTitle object (Word)

Represents the chart title.


## Remarks

Use the **[ChartTitle](Word.Chart.ChartTitle.md)** property to return the **ChartTitle** object.

The **ChartTitle** object does not exist and cannot be used unless the **[HasTitle](Word.Chart.HasTitle.md)** property for the chart is **True**.


## Example

 The following example adds a title to embedded chart one on the worksheet named **Sheet1**.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Chart 
 .HasTitle = True 
 .ChartTitle.Text = "February Sales" 
End With
```
