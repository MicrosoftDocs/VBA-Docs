```vb
Dim pgLoop As Page 
Dim shpLoop As Shape 
 
For Each pgLoop In ActiveDocument.Pages 
 For Each shpLoop In pgLoop.Shapes 
 If shpLoop.Type = pbLinkedPicture Then 
 
 With shpLoop.PictureFormat 
 
 Debug.Print "File Name: " & .Filename 
 Debug.Print "Original File Size: " & .OriginalFileSize & " bytes" 
 
 End With 
 End If 
 Next shpLoop
