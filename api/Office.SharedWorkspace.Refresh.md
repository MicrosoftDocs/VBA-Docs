# SharedWorkspace.Refresh Method (Office)

Refreshes the local cache of the [SharedWorkspace](Office.SharedWorkspace.md) object's files, folders, links, members, and tasks from the server.

> [!NOTE] 
> Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Refresh`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [SharedWorkspace](./Office.SharedWorkspace.md) object.


## Remarks

Use the  **Refresh** method to ensure that you are working with the most up-to-date list of objects and their properties from the shared workspace.


## Example

The following example refreshes the shared workspace if it has not been refreshed in the last 3 minutes. The example also handles the error condition where the workspace has not yet been refreshed.


```vb
    On Error GoTo err_NeverRefreshed 
    If DateDiff("s", ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.LastRefreshed, Now) > 180 Then 
        ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Refresh 
    End If 
    Exit Sub 
     
err_NeverRefreshed: 
          ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Refresh 

```
