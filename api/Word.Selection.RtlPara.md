# Selection.RtlPara method (Word)

Sets the reading order and alignment of the specified paragraphs to right-to-left.


## Syntax

_expression_. `RtlPara`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Selection](Word.Selection.md)** object.


## Remarks

For all selected paragraphs, this method sets the reading order to right-to-left. If a paragraph with a left-to-right reading order is also left-aligned, this method reverses its reading order and sets its paragraph alignment to right-aligned.

Use the **ReadingOrder** property to change the reading order without affecting paragraph alignment.


## Example

This example sets the reading order and alignment of the current selection to right-to-left if the selection isn't styled as "Normal."


```vb
If Selection.Style <> "Normal" Then _ 
 Selection.RtlPara
```
