# Window.ZoomLock Property (Visio)

Determines whether zooming is disabled in a Microsoft Visio drawing window. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ZoomLock`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Window](./Visio.Window.md) object.


### Return value

Boolean


## Remarks

Zooming (**False**) is the default Visio behavior. You can use the **ZoomLock** property to prevent zooming in any Visio drawing window, including page, master, and group windows. Attempting to set the **ZoomLock** for other windows, including stencil windows, ShapeSheet windows, and icon windows, will throw an exception.

The  **ZoomLock** property setting is valid only for a given window at run time, and is not persisted (saved) in either the Visio document or the registry.
