# MailItem.EntryID property (Outlook)

Returns a **String** representing the unique Entry ID of the object. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `EntryID`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [MailItem](Outlook.MailItem.md) object.


## Remarks

This property corresponds to the MAPI property  **PidTagEntryId**.

A MAPI store provider assigns a unique ID string when an item is created in its store. Therefore, the  **EntryID** property is not set for an Outlook item until it is saved or sent. The Entry ID changes when an item is moved into another store, for example, from your **Inbox** to a Microsoft Exchange Server public folder, or from one Personal Folders (.pst) file to another .pst file. Solutions should not depend on the **EntryID** property to be unique unless items will not be moved. The **EntryID** property returns a MAPI long-term Entry ID. For more information about long- and short-term **EntryID**s, search [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com) for **PidTagEntryId**.
