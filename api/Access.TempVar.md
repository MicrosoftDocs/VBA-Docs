# TempVar Object (Access)

Represents a variable that be used in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code or from a macro. 


## Remarks

A  **TempVar** objects provide a convenient way to exchange data between VBA procedures and macros.

Although a  **TempVar** object can be used to store information for use in VBA procedures, it does not have the same funcitonality as a VBA variable.


- By default, a  **TempVar** object remains in memory until Access is closed. You can use the **[Remove](Access.TempVars.Remove.md)** method or the[RemoveTempVar](overview/Access.md) macro action to remove a **TempVar** object.
    
- In VBA, a  **TempVar** object is accessible only to the members of the Access **[Application](Access.Application.md)** object, referenced databases, or add-ins.
    
- A  **TempVar** object can store only text or numeric data. **TempVar** objects cannot store objects.
    
To refer to a  **TempVar** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use the following syntax form:


-  **TempVar** ![name]
    

|**Name**|
|:-----|
|[Name](Access.TempVar.Name.md)|
|[Value](Access.TempVar.Value.md)|
