# Rows.AllowOverlap property (Word)

Returns or sets a value that specifies whether the specified rows can overlap other rows.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `AllowOverlap`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[Rows](Word.rows.md)' collection.


## Remarks

This property returns  **wdUndefined** if the specified rows include both overlapping rows and nonoverlapping rows. Can be set to either **True** or **False**. Read/write **Long**. Setting **AllowOverlap** to **True** also sets **WrapAroundText** to **True** , and setting **WrapAroundText** to **False** also sets **AllowOverlap** to **False**.

Because HTML doesn't support overlapping tables or shapes,  **AllowOverlap** is ignored in Web layout view.


## Example

This example specifies that text wraps around the selected table and that the table doesn't overlap any other wrapped tables.


```vb
Selection.Rows.WrapAroundText = True 
Selection.Rows.AllowOverlap = False
```

This example specifies that the first shape in the active document can overlap other shapes.




```vb
ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).WrapFormat.AllowOverlap = True
```
