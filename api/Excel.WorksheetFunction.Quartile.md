# WorksheetFunction.Quartile method (Excel)

Returns the quartile of a data set. Quartiles often are used in sales and survey data to divide populations into groups. For example, you can use QUARTILE to find the top 25 percent of incomes in a population.





 **Important**  This function has been replaced with one or more new functions that may provide improved accuracy and whose names better reflect their usage. This function is still available for compatibility with earlier versions of Excel. However, if backward compatibility is not required, you should consider using the new functions from now on, because they more accurately describe their functionality.

For more information about the new functions, see the [Quartile_Inc](Excel.WorksheetFunction.Quartile_Inc.md) and [Quartile_Exc](Excel.WorksheetFunction.Quartile_Exc.md) methods.
