# Page.Zoom Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets an **Integer** that specifies the percentage to increase or decrease the displayed image. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Zoom**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **Page** object.


## Remarks

The value of the  **Zoom** property specifies a percentage of image enlargement or reduction by which an image display should change. Values from 10 to 400 are valid. The value specified is a percentage of the object's original size; thus, a setting of 400 means you want to enlarge the image to four times its original size (or 400 percent), while a setting of 10 means you want to reduce the image to one-tenth of its original size (or 10 percent).
