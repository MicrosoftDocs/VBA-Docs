# Task.Type property (Project)

Gets or sets the way the task is calculated; that is, which one of units, duration, or work are fixed. Read/write  **PjTaskFixedType**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Type**

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Task](./Project.Task.md) object.


## Remarks

The **Type** property for a task can be one of the following **[PjTaskFixedType](Project.PjTaskFixedType.md)** constants: **pjFixedUnits**, **pjFixedDuration**, or **pjFixedWork**. The default value is **pjFixedUnits** for both automatically scheduled and manually scheduled tasks. The default task type can be set with the **DefaultTaskType** property for the **Project** object, or on the **Schedule** tab in the **Project Options** dialog box.




> [!NOTE] 
> Although the task type can be set for automatically scheduled tasks in the **Task Information** dialog box, the **Task type** drop-down list is disabled for manually scheduled tasks. However, you can programmatically change the task type for manually scheduled tasks. The **Task.Type** property is read/write for both manually scheduled and automatically scheduled tasks.
