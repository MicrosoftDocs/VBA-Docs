# CalloutFormat.Border property (Word)

Returns or sets whether the text in the specified callout is surrounded by a border. Read/write  **MsoTriState**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Border`

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[CalloutFormat](Word.CalloutFormat.md)' object.


## Example

This example adds an oval to the active document and a callout that points to the oval. The callout text won't have a border, but it will have a vertical accent bar that separates the text from the callout line.


```vb
Dim docActive As Document 
 
Set docActive = ActiveDocument 
 
With docActive.Shapes 
 .AddShape msoShapeOval, 180, 200, 280, 130 
 With .AddCallout(msoCalloutTwo, 420, 170, 170, 40) 
 .TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "My oval" 
 With .Callout 
 .Accent = True 
 .Border = False 
 End With 
 End With 
End With
```
