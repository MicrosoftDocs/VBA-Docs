# Dictionary.Path property (Word)

Returns the path to the specified dictionary. Read-only  **String**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Path**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Dictionary](Word.Dictionary.md)' object.


## Remarks

The path doesn't include a trailing character â€” for example, "C:\MSOffice" or "https://MyServer". Use the **PathSeparator** property to add the character that separates folders and drive letters. Use the **Name** property to return the file name without the path and use the **FullName** property to return the file name and the path together.


> [!NOTE] 
> You can use the **PathSeparator** property to build web addresses even though they contain forward slashes (/) and the **PathSeparator** property defaults to a backslash (\).
