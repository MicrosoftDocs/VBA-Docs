# Application.ToggleTPAutoExpand method (Project)

Expands or collapses resource rows in the Team Planner view, where there is more than one assignment within the same time span for a resource.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ToggleTPAutoExpand`

 _expression_ An expression that returns an **[Application](Project.Application.md)** object.


## Return value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks

You can manually expand or collapse the list of tasks for a single resource by choosing the **+** or **-** icon next to the resource name, or by using the **[ToggleTPResourceExpand](Project.Application.ToggleTPResourceExpand.md)** method. The **ToggleTPAutoExpand** method does the same action for all resources.


> [!NOTE] 
> The **+** or **-** icon does not show next to the resource name if there are no overlapping assignments for that resource.

The **ToggleTPAutoExpand** method corresponds to the **Expand Resource Rows** check box on the **Format** tab under **Team Planner Tools** in the ribbon.


## Example

In the following example, at least one resource has overlapping assignments. The **ToggleResourceRows** macro switches to the Team Planner view and expands or collapses the rows that have overlapping assignments. When a row is expanded, it is easier to see all of the overlapping assignments.


```vb
Sub ToggleResourceRows() 
    ViewApplyEx Name:="Team Planner" 
 
    ToggleTPAutoExpand 
End Sub
```
