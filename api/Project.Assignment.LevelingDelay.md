# Assignment.LevelingDelay property (Project)

Gets or sets the amount of time the assignment is delayed due to leveling. Read/write  **Variant**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `LevelingDelay`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Assignment](./Project.Assignment.md) object.


## Remarks

Project recalculates the leveling delay as resources are leveled across the project.

The **LevelingDelay** property does not return any meaningful information for assignments of material resources. Setting a value returns a trappable error (error code 1101) when applied to assignments of material resources.
