# Windows.WindowActivated Event (Visio)

Occurs after the active window changes in a Microsoft Visio instance.


## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression_ _'WindowActivated'(**_ByVal Window As [IVWINDOW]_**)

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Windows](./Visio.Windows.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Window_|Required| **[IVWINDOW]**|The window that was activated.|

## Remarks

The  **WindowActivated** event indicates that the active window has changed in a Visio instance. This event implies that the **ActiveDocument** and **ActivePage** properties of the **Application** object may also have changed; in contrast, any time the **ActiveDocument** or **ActivePage** property changes, a **WindowActivated** event is always generated.

If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event codes](../visio/Concepts/event-codesvisio.md).
