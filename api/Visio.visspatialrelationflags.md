Flags passed to various properties of the  **Shape** object, including the **DistanceFrom** , **DistanceFromPoint** , **SpatialNeighbors** , **SpatialRelation** , and **SpatialSearch** properties.



|Constant|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visSpatialBackToFront**|&H8|Order items back to front.|
| **visSpatialFrontToBack**|&H4|Order items front to back.|
| **visSpatialIgnoreVisible**|&H20|Do not consider visible Geometry sections. By default, visible Geometry sections influence the result.|
| **visSpatialIncludeContainerShapes**|&H80|Include containers. By default, containers are not included.|
| **visSpatialIncludeDataGraphics**|&H40|Include data graphic callout shapes and their sub-shapes. By default, data graphic callout shapes and their subshapes are not included. If the parent shape is itself a data graphic callout, searches are made between the parent shape's geometry and non-callout shapes, unless this flag is set.|
| **visSpatialIncludeGuides**|&H2|Consider a guide's Geometry section. By default, guides do not influence the result.|
| **visSpatialIncludeHidden**|&H10|Consider hidden Geometry sections. By default, hidden Geometry sections do not influence the result.|
