# Workbook.Saved property (Excel)

 **True** if no changes have been made to the specified workbook since it was last saved. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Saved`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Workbook](./Excel.Workbook.md) object.


## Remarks

If a workbook has never been saved, its  **[Path](Excel.Workbook.Path.md)** property returns an empty string ("").

You can set this property to  **True** if you want to close a modified workbook without either saving it or being prompted to save it.


## Example

This example displays a message if the active workbook contains unsaved changes.


```vb
If Not ActiveWorkbook.Saved Then 
 MsgBox "This workbook contains unsaved changes." 
End If
```
