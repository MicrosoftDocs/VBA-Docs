# Protection.AllowFiltering property (Excel)

Returns  **True** if the user is allowed to make use of an AutoFilter that was created before the sheet was protected. Read-only **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AllowFiltering`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Protection](Excel.Protection.md) object.


## Remarks

The  **AllowFiltering** property can be set by using the **[Protect](Excel.Worksheet.Protect.md)** method arguments.

The  **AllowFiltering** property allows the user to change filter criteria on an existing AutoFilter. The user cannot create or remove an AutoFilter on a protected worksheet.

The cells to be filtered must be unlocked when the sheet is protected.


## Example

This example allows the user to filter row 1 on the protected worksheet and notifies the user.


```vb
Sub ProtectionOptions() 
 
 ActiveSheet.Unprotect 
 
 ' Unlock row 1. 
 Rows("1:1").Locked = False 
 
 ' Allow row 1 to be filtered on a protected worksheet. 
 If ActiveSheet.Protection.AllowFiltering = False Then 
 ActiveSheet.Protect AllowFiltering:=True 
 End If 
 
 MsgBox "Row 1 can be filtered on this protected worksheet." 
 
End Sub
```
