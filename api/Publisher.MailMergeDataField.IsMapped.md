# MailMergeDataField.IsMapped Property (Publisher)

Indicates if the parent  **MailMergeDataField** object is mapped to a recipient field in the master data source (combined mail-merge recipient list). Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **IsMapped**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **MailMergeDataField** object.


### Return value

Boolean


## Remarks

The parent  **MailMergeDataField** object must represent a field (column) in a connected data source that is not the master data source (the combination of all connected data sources). The **IsMapped** property is not available for data fields in the data source represented by the **DataSource** property of the **MailMerge** object of the active **Document** object ( `ThisDocument.MailMerge.DataSource`).
