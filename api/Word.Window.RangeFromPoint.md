Returns the **Range** or **Shape** object that is located at the point specified by the screen position coordinate pair.


## Syntax

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Window](Word.Window.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _x_|Required| **Long**|The horizontal distance (in pixels) from the left edge of the screen to the point.|
| _y_|Required| **Long**|The vertical distance (in pixels) from the top of the screen to the point.|

## Return value

## Remarks

If no range or shape is located at the coordinate pair specified, the method returns  **Nothing**.


## Example

This example creates a new document and adds a five-point star. It then obtains the screen location of the shape and calculates where the center of the shape is. Using these coordinates, the example uses the **RangeFromPoint** method to return a reference to the shape and change its fill color.


```vb
Dim pLeft As Long 
Dim pTop As Long 
Dim pWidth As Long 
Dim pHeight As Long 
Dim newShape As Object 
Dim newDoc As New Document 
 
With newDoc 
 .Shapes.AddShape msoShape5pointStar, _ 
 288, 100, 100, 72 
 .ActiveWindow.GetPoint pLeft, pTop, _ 
 pWidth, pHeight, .Shapes(1) 
 Set newShape = .ActiveWindow.RangeFromPoint(pLeft _ 
 + pWidth * 0.5, pTop + pHeight * 0.5) 
 newShape.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(80, 160, 130) 
End With
```
