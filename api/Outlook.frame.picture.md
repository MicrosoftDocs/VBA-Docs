# Frame.Picture Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns a  **String** that specifies the full path name of a bitmap to display on a control. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Picture**

_expression_ A variable that represents a  **Frame** object.


## Remarks

You must use the control's property page to assign a bitmap to the  **Picture** property. You cannot use the Visual Basic **LoadPicture** function to assign a bitmap to **Picture**.

To remove a picture that is assigned to a control, click the value of the  **Picture** property in the property page and then press **DELETE**. Pressing  **BACKSPACE** will not remove the picture.

Use the  **[PictureSizeMode](Outlook.frame.picturesizemode.md)** property to determine how the picture fills the object.

Transparent pictures sometimes have a hazy appearance. If you do not like this appearance, display the picture on a control that supports opaque images.  **[Image](Outlook.image.md)** supports opaque images.
