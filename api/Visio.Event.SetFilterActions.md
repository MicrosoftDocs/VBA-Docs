# Event.SetFilterActions method (Visio)

Specifies the extensions to the  **MouseMove** event that Visio reports.


## Syntax

_expression_. `SetFilterActions`( `_filterActionStream()_` )

 _expression_ An expression that returns an **[Event](Visio.Event.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _filterActionStream()_|Required| **Long**|An array of action/value pairs. For more information, see Remarks.|

## Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

The  **SetFilterActions** method provides a way of ignoring selected extensions of the **MouseMove** event based on extension type. Extension types are based on mouse actions that are part of a drag and drop operation, as shown in the table below. By default, Visio reports firings of all event extensions.

The  _filterActionStream_ parameter is an array defined in the following way. The number of elements in _filterActionStream_ is a multiple of 3:


- The first element contains the beginning mouse action (**MouseMove** event extension) of the range (any member of **VisFilterActions**).
    
- The second element contains the end mouse action (**MouseMove** event extension) of the range (any member of **VisFilterActions** whose value is higher than that of the first element ).
    
- The third element contains a  **True** or **False** value indicating whether you want to listen to events for that action range (**True** to listen to events of a certain sub-type, or **MouseMove** event extension; **False** to exclude an event sub-type).
    
The filter actions that you can place in the first and second array elements of each element triplet are defined in the  **VisFilterActions** enumeration, which is declared in the Visio type library, and shown in the following table.



|Constant|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visFilterMouseMoveDragBegin**|1|Filter the  **DragBegin** extension of the **MouseMove** event.|
| **visFilterMouseMoveDragDrop**|5|Filter the  **DragDrop** extension of the **MouseMove** event.|
| **visFilterMouseMoveDragEnter**|2|Filter the  **DragEnter** extension of the **MouseMove** event.|
| **visFilterMouseMoveDragLeave**|4|Filter the  **DragLeave** extension of the **MouseMove** event.|
| **visFilterMouseMoveDragOver**|3|Filter the  **DragOver** extension of the **MouseMove** event.|
| **visFilterMouseMoveNoDrag**|0|Do not filter any extensions of the  **MouseMove** event.|

For example, if you want to listen to all  **MouseEvent** extensions except the **DragOver** event extension, you can build an array like the following:




```vb
Dim alngFilterActions(1 to 1 * 3) As Long  
    alngFilterActions(1) = visFilterMouseMoveDragDrop  
    alngFilterActions(2) = visFilterMouseMoveDragDrop  
    alngFilterActions(3) = False 

```

Or, to listen only to the  **DragEnter** event extension, ignoring mouse actions that come before and after, set up an array like the following:




```vb
Dim alngFilterActions(1 To (3 * 3)) As Long  
 
    'Listen to the "DragEnter" mouse action.  
    alngFilterActions(1) = visFilterMouseMoveDragEnter  
    alngFilterActions(2) = visFilterMouseMoveDragEnter   
    alngFilterActions(3) = True  
 
    'Ignore any mouse actions before "DragEnter."   
    alngFilterActions(4) = visFilterMouseMoveDragBegin  
    alngFilterActions(5) = visFilterMouseMoveDragEnter  - 1  
    alngFilterActions(6) = False  
 
    'Ignore any mouse actions after "DragEnter."   
    alngFilterActions(7) = visFilterMouseMoveDragEnter + 1  
    alngFilterActions(8) = visFilterMouseMoveDragDrop  
    alngFilterActions(9) = False 
 

```

Note that mouse actions that occupy the second position in an array-element triplet must always be later in the sequence (that is, higher in value) than those that occupy the first position in an array-element triplet.
