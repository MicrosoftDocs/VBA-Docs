# DataBar.Formula property (Excel)

Returns or sets a **String** representing a formula, which determines the values to which the data bar will be applied.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Formula**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[DataBar](Excel.DataBar.md)** object.


## Remarks

This property is useful to limit the range of values that will display the conditional format. A typical scenario is when you have a range of numbers containing both positive and negative values. You may want to create more than one conditional format for this range of numbers—one for positive values and another for negative values.
