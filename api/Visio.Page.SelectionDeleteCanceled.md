# Page.SelectionDeleteCanceled Event (Visio)

Occurs after an event handler has returned  **True** (cancel) to a **QueryCancelSelectionDelete** event.


## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression_ _'SelectionDeleteCanceled'(**_ByVal Selection As [IVSELECTION]_**)

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Page](./Visio.Page.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Selection_|Required| **[IVSELECTION]**|The selection of shapes that was going to be deleted.|

## Remarks

If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event codes](../visio/Concepts/event-codesvisio.md).
