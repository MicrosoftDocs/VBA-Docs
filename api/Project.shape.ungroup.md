## Syntax

_expression_.**Ungroup**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Shape](Project.Shape.md)** object.


## Return value

 **ShapeRange**


## Remarks

In general for applications that implement Office Art, the **Ungroup** method ungroups any group of shapes where the group contains the shape, and returns a **ShapeRange** object that represent the ungrouped shapes. Project does not support grouping of shapes in a report.
