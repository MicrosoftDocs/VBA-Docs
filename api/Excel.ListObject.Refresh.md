# ListObject.Refresh method (Excel)

Retrieves the current data and schema for the list from the server that is running Microsoft SharePoint Foundation. This method can be used only with lists that are linked to a SharePoint site. If the SharePoint site is not available, calling this method will return an error.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Refresh`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [ListObject](Excel.ListObject.md) object.


## Remarks

Calling the  **Refresh** method does not commit changes to the list in the Excel workbook. Uncommitted changes in the list in Excel are discarded when the **Refresh** method is called.
