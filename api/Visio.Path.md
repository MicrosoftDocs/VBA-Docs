# Path Object (Visio)

Represents a sequence of one or more segments whose ends abut. A path describes where a pen would move in order to draw one shape component. Each  **Path** object corresponds to a Geometry section of a shape.


## Remarks

The default property of a  **Path** object is **Item**.

A  **Curve** object is an item in a **Path** object that is any linear or curved segment representing a consecutive sequence of rows in the Geometry section that the **Path** object represents. The number of **Curve** objects in a **Path** object is not necessarily the same as the number of rows in its Geometry section.

The  **Path** object is conceptually of zero width. Line weights, patterns, and ends are ignored, but corner rounding is included. A **Path** object may or may not be closed, and it may intersect itself. For example, a **Path** object may describe a figure eight.

If you retrieve a  **Path** object from a collection obtained by the **Paths** property of a shape, its coordinates are expressed in the shape's parent coordinate system. If you retrieve a **Path** object from a collection obtained by the **PathsLocal** property of a shape, its coordinates are expressed in the shape's local coordinate system. In both cases, coordinates are expressed in internal drawing units (inches).
