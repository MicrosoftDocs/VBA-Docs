# Chart.ChartGroups Property (Project)
Gets an object that represents either a single chart group or a collection of chart groups, where a chart group represents one or more series of data points that are plotted with the same format. Read-only  **Object**.

## Syntax

 _expression_. `ChartGroups`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a 'Chart' object.


## Remarks

A chart contains one or more chart groups, and each chart group contains one or more series of data points.

    Dim chartShape As Shape
    Dim chartGroup As Office.IMsoChartGroup
    Dim dropLines As Boolean
    Dim reportName As String
    
    reportName = "Simple line chart"
    Set chartShape = ActiveProject.Reports(reportName).Shapes(1)
    
    Set chartGroup = chartShape.Chart.ChartGroups(1)
    dropLines = chartGroup.HasDropLines
    
    MsgBox "Chart group in " & reportName & ": " _
        & vbCrLf & "Drop lines: " & dropLines
