# SignatureProvider.NotifySignatureAdded method (Office)

Used to display a dialog box informing the user that the signing process has completed and providing additional functionality for the add-in.


## Syntax

_expression_. `NotifySignatureAdded`( `_ParentWindow_`, `_psigsetup_`, `_psiginfo_` )

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [SignatureProvider](Office.SignatureProvider.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _ParentWindow_|Required|**IOleWindow**|Allows the host application to obtain the handle to the window containing the displayed dialog box.|
| _psigsetup_|Required|**SignatureSetup**|Contains initial settings of the signature provider.|
| _psiginfo_|Required|**SignatureInfo**|Contains information about the signature provider add-in.|

## Remarks

This method is called when the signing process has completed. Allows a signature provider add-in the ability to add additional functionality to the add-in. For example, if you wanted to offer an archive service where a user could upload their signed document, you could use this method to initiate that process.


## Example

The following example, written in C#, shows the implementation of the  **NotifySignatureAdded** method in a custom signature provider project.


```vb
 public void NotifySignatureAdded(object parentWindow, SignatureSetup sigsetup, SignatureInfo siginfo) 
 { 
 using (Win32WindowFromOleWindow window = new Win32WindowFromOleWindow(parentWindow)) 
 { 
 MessageBox.Show(window, "Signature has been applied", "Signing Ceremony", MessageBoxButtons.OK); 
 } 
 } 

```

> [!NOTE] 
> Signature providers are implemented exclusively in custom COM add-ins and cannot be implemented in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).
