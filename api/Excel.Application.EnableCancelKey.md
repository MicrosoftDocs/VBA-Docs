# Application.EnableCancelKey property (Excel)

Controls how Microsoft Excel handles CTRL+BREAK (or ESC or COMMAND+PERIOD) user interruptions to the running procedure. Read/write  **[xlEnableCancelKey](Excel.XlEnableCancelKey.md)**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `EnableCancelKey`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application-graph-property.md) object.


## Remarks



| **xlEnableCancelKey** can be one of these **xlEnableCancelKey** constants.|
| **xlDisabled**. Cancel key trapping is completely disabled.|
| **xlErrorHandler**. The interrupt is sent to the running procedure as an error, trappable by an error handler set up with an `On Error GoTo` statement. The trappable error code is 18.|
| **xlInterrupt**. The current procedure is interrupted, and the user can debug or end the procedure.|

Use this property very carefully. If you use  **xlDisabled** , there's no way to interrupt a runaway loop or other non - self-terminating code. Likewise, if you use **xlErrorHandler** but your error handler always returns using the `Resume` statement, there's no way to stop runaway code.

The  **EnableCancelKey** property is always reset to **xlInterrupt** whenever Microsoft Excel returns to the idle state and there's no code running. To trap or disable cancellation in your procedure, you must explicitly change the **EnableCancelKey** property every time the procedure is called.


## Example

This example shows how you can use the  **EnableCancelKey** property to set up a custom cancellation handler.


```vb
On Error GoTo handleCancel 
Application.EnableCancelKey = xlErrorHandler 
MsgBox "This may take a long time: press ESC to cancel" 
For x = 1 To 1000000 ' Do something 1,000,000 times (long!) 
 ' do something here 
Next x 
 
handleCancel: 
If Err = 18 Then 
 MsgBox "You cancelled" 
End If
```
