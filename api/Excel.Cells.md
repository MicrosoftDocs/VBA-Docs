# Cells Property

Returns a Range object that represents the cells in the specified range, as it applies to the Range object. Also, returns a Range object that represents all the cells on the datasheet (not just the cells that are currently in use), as it applies to the DataSheet object. Read-only Range object.

_expression_. `Cells`

 _expression_ Required. An expression that returns an object in the **Applies To** list.


## Example

This example clears the formula in cell A1 on the datasheet. Note that on the datasheet, column A is the second column and row 1 is the second row.


```vb
myChart.Application.DataSheet.Cells(2,2).ClearContents
```

This example loops through cells A1:I3 on the datasheet. If any of these cells contains a value less than 0.001, the example replaces that value with 0 (zero).




```vb
Set mySheet = myChart.Application.DataSheet 
For rwIndex = 2 to 4 
 For colIndex = 2 to 10 
 If mySheet.Cells(rwIndex, colIndex) < .001 Then 
 mySheet.Cells(rwIndex, colIndex).Value = 0 
 End If 
 Next colIndex 
Next rwIndex
```
