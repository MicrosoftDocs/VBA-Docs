 ' Initialize with first character of name. 
 NewInits = Mid(R.Name, 1, 1) 
 
 ' Look for spaces in the resource's name. 
 For I = 1 To Len(R.Name) 
 ' If not first character, and space is found, then add initial. 
 If I > 1 And Mid(R.Name, I, 1) = Chr(32) Then 
 If I + 1 <= Len(R.Name) Then 
 NewInits = NewInits & Mid(R.Name, I + 1, 1) 
 End If 
 End If 
 Next I 
 
 ' Give the resource its new initials.
