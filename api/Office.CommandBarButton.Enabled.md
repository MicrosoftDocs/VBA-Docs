## Syntax

 _expression_. `Enabled`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[CommandBarButton](Office.CommandBarButton.md)' object.


### Return Value

## Remarks

For command bars, setting this property to  **True** causes the name of the command bar to appear in the list of available command bars.
