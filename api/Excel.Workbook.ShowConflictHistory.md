# Workbook.ShowConflictHistory property (Excel)

 **True** if the Conflict History worksheet is visible in the workbook that's open as a shared list. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ShowConflictHistory`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Workbook](./Excel.Workbook.md) object.


## Remarks

If the specified workbook isn't open as a shared list, this property fails. To determine whether a workbook is open as a shared list, use the  **MultiUserEditing** property.


## Example

This example determines whether the active workbook is open as a shared list. If it is, the example displays the Conflict History worksheet.


```vb
If ActiveWorkbook.MultiUserEditing Then 
 ActiveWorkbook.ShowConflictHistory = True 
End If
```
