# Shape.OneD Property (Visio)

Determines whether an object behaves as a one-dimensional (1-D) object. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `OneD`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Shape](./Visio.Shape.md) object.


### Return value

Integer


## Remarks

Setting the  **OneD** property is equivalent to changing a shape's interaction style in the **Behavior** dialog box (click **Behavior** in the **Shape Design** group of the [Developer](../visio/How-to/run-visio-in-developer-mode.md) tab). Setting the **OneD** property for a 1-D shape to **False** deletes its 1-D Endpoints section, even if the cells in that section were protected with the GUARD function.

The  **OneD** property of a **Shape** object that is a guide is always 0. If you try to change the value of the **OneD** property of a guide shape, no error is raised, but the value remains 0.

The  **OneD** property of an object from another application is always **False** .
