# Application.DDETerminateAll method (Word)

Closes all dynamic data exchange (DDE) channels opened by Microsoft Word.


## Syntax

_expression_. `DDETerminateAll`

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Application](Word.Application.md)** object.  Optional.


## Remarks

This method does not close channels opened to Word by client applications. Using this method is the same as using the **[DDETerminate](Word.Application.DDETerminate.md)** method for each open channel.

If you interrupt a macro that opens a DDE channel, you may inadvertently leave a channel open. Open channels are not closed automatically when a macro ends, and each open channel uses system resources. For this reason, it is a good idea to use this method when you are debugging a macro that opens one or more DDE channels.


## Example

This example opens the Microsoft Excel workbook Book1.xls, inserts text into cell R2C3, saves the workbook, and then terminates all DDE channels.


```vb
Dim lngChannel As Long 
 
lngChannel = DDEInitiate(App:="Excel", Topic:="System") 
DDEExecute Channel:=lngChannel, Command:="[OPEN(" & Chr(34) & _ 
 "C:\Documents\Book1.xls" & Chr(34) & ")]" 
DDETerminate Channel:=lngChannel 
lngChannel = DDEInitiate(App:="Excel", Topic:="Book1.xls") 
DDEPoke Channel:=lngChannel, Item:="R2C3", Data:="Hello World" 
DDEExecute Channel:=lngChannel, Command:="[Save]" 
DDETerminateAll
```
