# Document.Close Method (Visio)

Closes a document.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Close`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Document](./Visio.Document.md) object.


## Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

If the indicated window is the only window open for a document and the document contains unsaved changes, an alert appears asking if you want to save the document. You can use the  **AlertResponse** property to prevent the alert from appearing.

If you close a docked stencil window, only that window is closed. However, if you close a drawing window that contains docked stencils, the docked stencil window is also closed.
