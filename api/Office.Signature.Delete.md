# Signature.Delete Method (Office)

Deletes the  **Signature** object from the collection.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Delete`

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Signature](Office.Signature.md)' object.


## Remarks

For the  **Scripts** collection, using the **Delete** method removes all scripts from the specified Microsoft Word document, Microsoft Excel worksheet, or Microsoft PowerPoint slide. A script anchor is represented by a shape in the host application. Therefore, the **Shape** object associated with each script anchor of type **msoScriptAnchor** is deleted from the **Shapes** collection in Excel and PowerPoint and from the **InlineShapes** and **Shapes** collections in Word.
