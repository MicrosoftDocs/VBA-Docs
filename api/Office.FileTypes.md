# FileTypes Object (Office)

A collection of values of the type  **msoFileType** that determine which types of files are returned during a search.


## Remarks

There is only one  **FileTypes** collection for all searches so it's important to clear the **FileTypes** collection before executing a search unless you wish to search for file types from previous searches. The easiest way to clear the collection is to set the **FileType** property to the first file type for which you want to search. You can also remove individual types using the **Remove** method. To determine the file type of each item in the collection, use the **Item** method to return the **msoFileType** value.
