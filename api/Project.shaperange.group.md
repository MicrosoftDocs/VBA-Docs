# ShapeRange.Group method (Project)
The  **Group** method is not implemented in Project.

## Syntax

_expression_.**Group**

_expression_ A variable that represents a 'ShapeRange' object.


## Return value

 **Shape**


## Remarks

In general for applications that implement Office Art, the  **Group** method groups the shapes in the shape range, and returns the grouped shapes as a single **Shape** object. Project does not support automatic grouping of shapes in a report.
