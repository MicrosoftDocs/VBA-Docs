# AddIns object (Word)

A collection of  **AddIn** objects that represents all the add-ins available to Word, regardless of whether or not they are currently loaded. The **AddIns** collection includes global templates or Word add-in libraries (WLLs) displayed in the **Templates and Add-ins** dialog box.


## Remarks

Use the  **AddIns** property to return the **AddIns** collection. The following example displays the name and the installed state of each available add-in.


```vb
For Each ad In AddIns 
 If ad.Installed = True Then 
 MsgBox ad.Name & " is installed" 
 Else 
 MsgBox ad.Name & " is available but not installed" 
 End If 
Next ad
```

Use the  **Add** method to add an add-in to the list of available add-ins and (optionally) install it using the Install argument.




```vb
AddIns.Add FileName:="C:\Templates\Other\Letter.dot", Install:=True
```

To install an add-in shown in the list of available add-ins, use the  **Installed** property.




```vb
AddIns("Letter.dot").Installed = True
```

Use  **AddIns** (index), where index is the add-in name or index number, to return a single **[AddIn](Word.AddIn.md)** object. You must exactly match the spelling (but not necessarily the capitalization) of the name, as it is shown in the **Templates and Add-ins** dialog box. To install an add-in shown in the list of available add-ins, use the **Installed** property. The following example loads the Letter.dot template as a global template.




```vb
AddIns("Letter.dot").Installed = True
```


 **Note**  If the add-in is not located in the User Templates, Workgroup Templates, or Startup folder, you must specify the full path and file name when indexing an add-in by name.

Use the  **Compiled** property to determine whether an **AddIn** object is a template or a WLL.
