# OLEDBErrors object (Excel)

A collection of  **[OLEDBError](Excel.OLEDBError.md)** objects.


## Remarks

 Each **OLEDBError** object represents an error returned by the most recent OLE DB query. If the specified OLE DB query runs without error, the **OLEDBErrors** collection is empty. The errors in the collection are indexed in the order in which they're generated by the OLE DB provider. You cannot add members to the collection.


## Example

Use the  **[OLEDBErrors](Excel.Application.OLEDBErrors.md)** property to return the **OLEDBErrors** collection. The following example displays the error description and the **[SqlState](Excel.OLEDBError.SqlState.md)** property's value for each OLE DB error in the collection.


```vb
For Each objEr in Application.OLEDBErrors 
 MsgBox "The following error occurred:" & _ 
 objEr.ErrorString & " : " & objEr.SqlState 
Next objEr
```

Use  **OLEDBErrors** ( _index_ ), where _index_ is the index number of the OLE DB error, to return a single **OLEDBError** object. The following example displays the error description and the **SqlState** property's value for the first error returned by the most recent OLE DB query.




```vb
Set objEr = Application.OLEDBErrors(1) 
MsgBox "The following error occurred:" & _ 
 objEr.ErrorString & " : " & objEr.SqlState
```
