## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _FormRegionName_|Required| **String**|The name of the form region which is the name used when registering the form region in the Windows registry.|
| _LCID_|Required| **Long**|The locale ID that identifies the language that Outlook is currently using. This value is used to obtain the localization strings corresponding to this language for the form region.|
| _Icon_|Required| **[OlFormRegionIcon](Outlook.OlFormRegionIcon.md)**|A constant that identifies the type of icon.|

## Return value

A Variant that is either a byte-array that represents the original bytes of the image file or an **IPictureDisp** object.


## Remarks

This method is intended to be implemented by an add-in and called by Outlook. As part of the  **[FormRegionStartup](Outlook.formregionstartup.md)** interface, this method and the **[GetFormRegionManifest](Outlook.FormRegionStartup.GetFormRegionManifest.md)** method provide a mechanism through which an add-in can register a form region and provide Outlook with the XML manifest and the icons for the form region.

If you would like an add-in to provide icons for a form region, specify the ProgID of the add-in when you register the form region in the Windows registry. For more information on registering a form region, see [Specifying Form Regions in the Windows Registry](../outlook/Concepts/Creating-Form-Regions/specifying-form-regions-in-the-windows-registry.md). The add-in must implement the  **GetFormRegionManifest** and the **GetFormRegionIcon** methods of the **FormRegionStartup** interface.

In the XML manifest for the form region, under the  **icons** element, specify the value `addin` for each of the child elements where you would like to use a custom icon. Implement **GetFormRegionIcon** such that when Outlook passes that type of icon as an argument for _Icon_ , **GetFormRegionIcon** returns the image of the custom icon. If you want Outlook to display the default icon, implement **GetFormRegionIcon** such that it returns **null** (**Nothing** in Visual Basic) for that type of icon. **GetFormRegionIcon** should also return **null** (**Nothing** in Visual Basic) when _Icon_ is **olFormRegionIconDefault**.

 When Outlook starts, it reads the list of form regions from the Windows registry and caches the data associated with the form regions. If a form region has been registered with a ProgID, Outlook will resort to the corresponding add-in by calling its implementation of **GetFormRegionIcon** for any icon in the XML manifest that has `addin` as the value of a child element of the **icons** element. Note that if you do not specify any ProgID in the Windows registry, Outlook will not call the **GetFormRegionManifest** and **GetFormRegionIcon** methods.
