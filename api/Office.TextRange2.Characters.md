If Length is specified but Start is omitted, the returned range starts with the first character in the specified range.

If Length is greater than the number of characters from the specified starting character to the end of the text, the returned range contains all those characters.


## Example

This example sets the text for shape two on slide one in the active presentation and then makes the second character a subscript character with a 20-percent offset.


```vb
Dim charRange As TextRange2 
With Application.ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(2) 
 Set charRange = .TextFrame.TextRange2.InsertBefore("H2O") 
 charRange.Characters(2).Font.BaselineOffset = -0.2 
End With 

```
