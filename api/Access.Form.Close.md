# Form.Close event (Access)

The  **Close** event occurs when a form is closed and removed from the screen.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Close`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Form](Access.Form.md) object.


## Return value

nothing


## Remarks

To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **OnClose** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

The  **Close** event occurs after the **Unload** event, which is triggered after the form is closed but before it is removed from the screen.

When you close a form, the following events occur in this order:

 **Unload** → **Deactivate** → **Close**

When the  **Close** event occurs, you can open another window or request the user's name to make a log entry indicating who used the form or report.

The  **Unload** event can be canceled, but the **Close** event can't.
