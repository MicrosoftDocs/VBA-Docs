# Folder.GetCustomIcon Method (Outlook)

Returns an  **[IPictureDisp](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms680762%28VS.85%29.aspx)** object that represents the custom icon for the folder.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `GetCustomIcon`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[Folder](Outlook.Folder.md)' object.


### Return Value

An  **IPictureDisp** object that represents a custom icon for the folder.


## Remarks

The returned  **IPictureDisp** object has its **Type** property equal to **PICTYPE_ICON** or **PICTYPE_BITMAP** .

 **GetCustomIcon** returns **Null** (**Nothing** in Visual Basic) if the folder does not have a custom folder icon, or if the folder belongs to one of the following groups of folders:


- Default folders (as listed by the  **[OlDefaultFolders](Outlook.OlDefaultFolders.md)** enumeration)
    
- Special folders (as listed by the  **[OlSpecialFolders](Outlook.OlSpecialFolders.md)** enumeration)
    
- Exchange public folders
    
-  Root folder of any Exchange mailbox
    
- Hidden folders
    
You can only call  **GetCustomIcon** from code that runs in-process as Outlook. An **IPictureDisp** object cannot be marshaled across process boundaries. If you attempt to call **GetCustomIcon** from out-of-process code, an exception occurs. For more information, see [An automation server cannot pass a pointer to the picture object's IPictureDisp implementation across process boundaries](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/150034).
