# Workbook.Save Method (Excel)

Saves changes to the specified workbook.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Save`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Workbook](./Excel.Workbook.md) object.


## Remarks

To open a workbook file, use the  **[Open](Excel.Workbooks.Open.md)** method.

To mark a workbook as saved without writing it to a disk, set its  **[Saved](Excel.Workbook.Saved.md)** property to **True** .

The first time you save a workbook, use the  **[SaveAs](Excel.Workbook.SaveAs.md)** method to specify a name for the file.


## Example

This example saves the active workbook.


```vb
ActiveWorkbook.Save
```

This example saves all open workbooks and then closes Microsoft Excel.




```vb
For Each w In Application.Workbooks 
    w.Save 
Next w 
Application.Quit
```

 **Sample code provided by:** Holy Macro! Books, [Holy Macro! It's 2,500 Excel VBA Examples](https://www.mrexcel.com/store/index.php?l=product_detail&;p=1)

This example uses the  **BeforeSave** event to verify that certain cells contain data before the workbook can be saved. The workbook cannot be saved until there is data in each of the following cells: D5, D7, D9, D11, D13, and D15.




```vb
Private Sub Workbook_BeforeSave(ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean)
   'If the six specified cells do not contain data, then display a message box with an error
   'and cancel the attempt to save.
   If WorksheetFunction.CountA(Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("D5,D7,D9,D11,D13, D15")) < 6 Then
      MsgBox "Workbook will not be saved unless" & vbCrLf & _
      "All required fields have been filled in!"
      Cancel = True
   End If
End Sub
```
