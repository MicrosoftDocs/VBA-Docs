# ChartGroup.SplitType Property (PowerPoint)

## Syntax

 _expression_. `SplitType`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[ChartGroup](PowerPoint.ChartGroup.md)' object.


## Example

```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        With .Chart.ChartGroups(1)

            .SplitType = xlSplitByValue

            .SplitValue = 10

            .VaryByCategories = True

        End With

    End If

End With
```
