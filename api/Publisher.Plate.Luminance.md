# Plate.Luminance Property (Publisher)

Returns or sets a  **Long** indicating a calculated luminance value for the specified plate; used for spot-color trapping. Valid values are from 0 to 100. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Luminance**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **Plate** object.


### Return Value

Long


## Remarks

This property is valid only for publications with a  ** [ColorMode](./overview/Publisher.md)** property value of **pbColorModeSpot** or for spot plates in a publication with a **ColorMode** property value of **pbColorModeSpotAndProcess**.


## Example

The following example loops through all the spot-color plates in a publication and reports their luminance values.


```vb
Dim plaTemp As Plates 
Dim plaLoop As Plate 
 
Set plaTemp = ActiveDocument.Plates 
 
If ActiveDocument.ColorMode <> pbColorModeSpot And _ 
 ActiveDocument.ColorMode <> pbColorModeSpotAndProcess Then 
 Debug.Print "No spot colors in this publication." 
Else 
 For Each plaLoop In plaTemp 
 With plaLoop 
 Debug.Print "Plate " &; .Name _ 
 &; " has a luminance of " &; .Luminance 
 End With
