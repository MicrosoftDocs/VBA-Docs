## Syntax

 _expression_. `CanCheckIn`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Presentation](./PowerPoint.Presentation.md) object.

## Example

This example checks the server to see if the specified presentation can be checked in and, if it can be, closes the presentation and checks it back into server.


```vb
Sub CheckInPresentation(strPresentation As String)

    If Presentations(strPresentation).CanCheckIn = True Then
        Presentations(strPresentation).CheckIn
        MsgBox strPresentation & " has been checked in."
    Else
        MsgBox strPresentation & " cannot be checked in " & _
        "at this time.  Please try again later."
    End If

End Sub
```

To call the subroutine above, use the following subroutine and replace the " _https://servername/workspace/report.ppt_ " file name with an actual file located on a server mentioned in the Remarks section above.

Sub CheckPPTIn()
    Call CheckInPresentation(strPresentation:= _
        "https://servername/workspace/report.ppt ")
End Sub
