Gets or sets the ordinal position of a  **GraphicItem** object in the **GraphicItems** collection of a data graphic masterâ€”a **Master** object of type **visTypeDataGraphic**. Read/write.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Index`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [GraphicItem](./Visio.GraphicItem.md) object.


## Return value

Long


## Remarks

The index of a graphic item is originally determined by the order in which the item was added to the collection. The  **GraphicItems** collection is 1-based.

The index order of graphic items affects the stacking order for multiple grpahic item callouts assigned to the same location. In addition, it determiones which graphic item takes precedence in control over a cell in the Microsoft Visio ShapeSheet spreadsheet when conflicting conditions set by multiple graphic items are all true .


 **Note**  Before you can set any property of a graphic item, you must use the  **[Master.Open](Visio.Master.Open.md)** method to open a copy of the data graphic master that contains the graphic item for editing. When you are finished setting properties, use the **Master.Close** method to commit changes.
