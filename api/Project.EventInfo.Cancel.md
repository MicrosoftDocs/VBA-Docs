# EventInfo.Cancel property (Project)

In an event handler, the **Cancel** property gets or sets a value that specifies whether the operation that triggered the event should continue. If **True**, the operation is canceled. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Cancel`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [EventInfo](./Project.EventInfo.md) object.


## Remarks

The default value of the **Cancel** property is **False** when an event occurs. Set **Cancel** to **True** to cancel an operation.


## Example

The following event handler examines new resource assignments and cancels them if they are for the specified resource.


```vb
Private Sub App_ProjectBeforeAssignmentChange2(ByVal asg As Assignment, ByVal Field As PjAssignmentField, _ 
 ByVal NewVal As Variant, EventInfo As Object) 
 
 If Field = pjAssignmentResourceName And NewVal = "Lisa Jones" Then 
 MsgBox "Lisa is no longer available for assignment!" 
 EventInfo.Cancel = True 
 End If 
End Sub
```
