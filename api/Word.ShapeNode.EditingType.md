# ShapeNode.EditingType property (Word)

If the specified node is a vertex, this property returns a value that indicates how changes made to the node affect the two segments connected to the node. Read-only  **MsoEditingType**. .


## Syntax

_expression_.**EditingType**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[ShapeNode](Word.ShapeNode.md)** object.


## Remarks

If the node is a control point for a curved segment, this property returns the editing type of the adjacent vertex. This property is read-only. Use the **SetEditingType** method to set the value of this property.


## Example

This example changes all corner nodes to smooth nodes in the third shape on the active document. The third shape must be a freeform drawing.


```vb
Dim docActive As Document 
Dim intCount As Integer 
 
Set docActive = ActiveDocument 
 
With docActive.Shapes(3).Nodes 
 For intCount = 1 to .Count 
 If .Item(intCount).EditingType = msoEditingCorner Then 
 .SetEditingType intCount, msoEditingSmooth 
 End If 
 Next 
End With
```
