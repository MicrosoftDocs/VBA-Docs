# Options.AllowAccentedUppercase property (Word)

 **True** if accents are retained when a French language character is changed to uppercase. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AllowAccentedUppercase`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[Options](Word.Options.md)' object.


## Remarks

This property affects only text that's been marked as standard French. For all other languages, accents are always retained even if the  **AllowAccentedUppercase** property is set to **False**.

If you change a character back to lowercase after an accent mark has been stripped from it, the accent won't reappear.


## Example

This example sets Word to remove accent marks when characters in French text are changed to uppercase.


```vb
Options.AllowAccentedUppercase = False
```

This example returns the status of the Allow accented uppercase in French option on the Edit tab in the Options dialog box.




```vb
Dim blnUppercaseAccents as Boolean 
 
blnUppercaseAccents = Options.AllowAccentedUppercase
```
