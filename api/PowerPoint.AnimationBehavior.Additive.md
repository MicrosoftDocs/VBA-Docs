# AnimationBehavior.Additive property (PowerPoint)

Sets or returns whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Additive`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [AnimationBehavior](PowerPoint.AnimationBehavior.md) object.


## Return value

MsoAnimAdditive


## Remarks

The value of the  **Additive** property can be one of these **MsoAnimAdditive** constants.



|Constant|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|**msoAnimAdditiveAddBase**|Does not combine current animation with other animations. The default.|
|**msoAnimAdditiveAddSum**| Combines the current animation with other running animations.|

Combining animation behaviors is particularly useful for rotation effects. For example, if the current animation changes rotation and another animation is also changing rotation, if this property is set to  **msoAnimAdditiveAddSum**, Microsoft PowerPoint adds together the rotations from both the animations.


## Example

The following example allows the current animation behavior to be added to another animation behavior.


```vb
Sub SetAdditive()

    Dim animBehavior As AnimationBehavior

    Set animBehavior = ActiveWindow.Selection.SlideRange(1) _
        .TimeLine.MainSequence(1).Behaviors(1)

    animBehavior.Additive = msoAnimAdditiveAddSum

End Sub
```
