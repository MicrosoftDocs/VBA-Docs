# Style.InUse property (Word)

 **True** if the specified style is a built-in style that has been modified or applied in the document or a new style that has been created in the document. Read-only **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `InUse`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a '[Style](Word.Style.md)' object.


## Remarks

The **InUse** property doesn't necessarily indicate whether the style is currently applied to any text in the document. For instance, if text that's been formatted with a style is deleted, the **InUse** property of the style remains **True**. For built-in styles that have never been used in the document, this property returns **False**.


## Example

This example displays a message box that lists the names of all the styles that are currently being used in the active document.


```vb
Dim docActive As Document 
Dim strMessage As String 
Dim styleLoop As Style 
 
Set docActive = ActiveDocument 
 
strMessage = "Styles in use:" & vbCr 
 
For Each styleLoop In docActive.Styles 
 If styleLoop.InUse = True Then 
 With docActive 
 .Content.Find 
 .ClearFormatting 
 .Text = "" 
 .Style = styleLoop 
 .Execute Format:=True 
 If .Found = True Then 
 strMessage = strMessage & styleLoop.Name & vbCr 
 End If 
 End With 
 End If 
Next styleLoop 
 
MsgBox strMessage
```
