# ReportItem.AutoResolvedWinner property (Outlook)

Returns a **Boolean** that determines if the item is a winner of an automatic conflict resolution. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AutoResolvedWinner`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [ReportItem](Outlook.ReportItem.md) object.


## Remarks

A value of  **False** does not necessarily indicate that the item is a loser of an automatic conflict resolution. The item could be in conflict with another item.

If an item has  **[Conflicts.Count](Outlook.Conflicts.Count.md)** of its **[ReportItem.Conflicts](Outlook.ReportItem.Conflicts.md)** property greater than zero and if its **AutoResolvedWinner** property is **True**, it is a winner of an automatic conflict resolution.
