# Application.WorkbookBeforeSave Event (Excel)

Occurs before any open workbook is saved.

**NOTE:** In Office 365, Excel supports AutoSave, which enables the user's edits to be saved automatically and continuously. Following the guidance in [this article](../Library-Reference/Concepts/how-autosave-impacts-addins-and-macros.md) will ensure that running code in response to the **WorkbookBeforeSave** event will function as intended when AutoSave is enabled.

## Syntax

_expression_. `WorkbookBeforeSave`( `_Wb_` , `_SaveAsUI_` , `_Cancel_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application-graph-property.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Wb_|Required| **[Workbook](Excel.Workbook.md)**|The workbook.|
| _SaveAsUI_|Required| **Boolean**| **True** if the **Save As** dialog box will be displayed due to changes made that need to be saved in the workbook.|
| _Cancel_|Required| **Boolean**| **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True** , the workbook isn't saved when the procedure is finished.|

## Return value

Nothing


## Example

This example prompts the user for a yes or no response before saving any workbook.


```vb
Private Sub App_WorkbookBeforeSave(ByVal Wb As Workbook, _ 
 ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel as Boolean) 
 a = MsgBox("Do you really want to save the workbook?", vbYesNo) 
 If a = vbNo Then Cancel = True 
End Sub
```
