# Shape.Left property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the horizontal position, measured in points, of the specified shape or shape range. Can also be any valid **[WdShapePosition](Word.WdShapePosition.md)** constant. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Left**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Shape](Word.Shape.md)** object.


## Remarks

The position of a shape is measured from the upper-left corner of the shape's bounding box to the shape's anchor. The **RelativeHorizontalPosition** property controls whether the anchor is positioned alongside a character, column, margin, or the edge of the page.


## Example

This example sets the horizontal position of the first shape in the active document to 1 inch from the left edge of the page.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Shapes(1) 
 .RelativeHorizontalPosition = _ 
 wdRelativeHorizontalPositionPage 
 .Left = InchesToPoints(1) 
End With
```
