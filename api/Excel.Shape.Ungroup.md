# Shape.Ungroup method (Excel)

Ungroups any grouped shapes in the specified shape or range of shapes. Disassembles pictures and OLE objects within the specified shape or range of shapes.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Ungroup`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Shape](./Excel.Shape.md) object.


## Return value

A  **[ShapeRange](Excel.ShapeRange.md)** object that represents the ungrouped shapes.


## Remarks

Because a group of shapes is treated as a single object, grouping and ungrouping shapes changes the number of items in the  **Shapes** collection and changes the index numbers of items that come after the affected items in the collection.


## Example

This example ungroups any grouped shapes and disassembles any pictures or OLE objects on  `myDocument`.


```vb
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
For Each s In myDocument.Shapes 
 s.Ungroup 
Next
```

This example ungroups any grouped shapes on  `myDocument` without disassembling pictures or OLE objects on the document.




```vb
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
For Each s In myDocument.Shapes 
 If s.Type = msoGroup Then s.Ungroup
```
