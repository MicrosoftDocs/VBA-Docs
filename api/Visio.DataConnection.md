# DataConnection Object (Visio)

Abstracts communication between one or more  **[DataRecordset](Visio.DataRecordset.md)** objects and a non-XML data source.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Remarks

The default property of the  **DataConnection** object is **ID**.

When you add a new  **DataRecordset** object to the **DataRecordsets** collection (by using a method other than **[DataRecordsets.AddFromXML](Visio.DataRecordsets.AddFromXML.md)**) and you do not specify an existing **DataConnection** object (by passing the connection string associated with it to the **[DataRecordsets.Add](Visio.DataRecordsets.Add.md)** method), Visio creates a new **DataConnection** object.

The  **DataConnection** object exposes properties that make it possible to access data-source connection settings:




-  The **[ConnectionString](Visio.DataConnection.ConnectionString.md)** property gets or sets the connection string used to access an existing **DataConnection** object or to create a new **DataConnection** object. Note that setting this property to a new value does not immediately change the connectionâ€”Visio re-evaluates this property only when the **[DataRecordset.Refresh ](Visio.DataRecordset.Refresh.md)** method is called.
    
- The  **[Timeout](Visio.DataConnection.Timeout.md)** property determines how long (in seconds) Visio should attempt to establish a data-source connection before terminating the connection attempt and generating an error. The default is 15 seconds.
    
- The  **[FileName](Visio.DataConnection.FileName.md)** property gets or sets the name of the Office Data Connection (ODC) file that contains the data-source connection and query information used to create a new connection and to refresh data from an existing connection.
    


Multiple  **DataRecordset** objects can share the same **DataConnection** object. When any of the data recordsets that share a data connection are refreshed, all are refreshed.
