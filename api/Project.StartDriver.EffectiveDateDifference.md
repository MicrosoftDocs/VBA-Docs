# StartDriver.EffectiveDateDifference property (Project)

Gets the duration between two dates in minutes, using the effective calendar for a manually scheduled task. Read-only  **Long**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `EffectiveDateDifference`( `_StartDate_`, `_FinishDate_` )

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [StartDriver](./Project.StartDriver.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _StartDate_|Required|**Variant**|Arbitrary start date and time, for example, "7/10/2010" or "7/10/2010 2:00:00 PM".|
| _FinishDate_|Required|**Variant**|Arbitrary finish date and time.|

## Remarks

The **EffectiveDateDifference** property uses the effective calendar for manually scheduled tasks, which allows tasks to start and finish on non-working times. The StartDate and FinishDate arguments can be arbitrary dates. The property and arguments do not affect the task dates.

You can use the **[EffectiveDateSubtract](Project.StartDriver.EffectiveDateSubtract.md)**, **[EffectiveDateAdd](Project.StartDriver.EffectiveDateAdd.md)**, and **EffectiveDateDifference** properties to calculate start and finish dates for manually scheduled tasks.

To calculate the date difference for an automatically scheduled task, where you can also specify the calendar, use the **[DateDifference](Project.Application.DateDifference.md)** method.


## Example

The following statement returns the value 480, which shows that the finish date is 8 hours of working time after the start date. 


```vb
Debug.Print ActiveProject.Tasks(3).StartDriver.EffectiveDateDifference("7/1/2009 3:00:00 PM", "7/2/2009 3:00:00 PM")
```

The following statement returns the value -840, which shows that the finish date is 14 hours of working time before the start date. 




```vb
Debug.Print ActiveProject.Tasks(3).StartDriver.EffectiveDateDifference("7/1/2009 3:00:00 PM", "6/30/2009 8:00:00 AM")
```
