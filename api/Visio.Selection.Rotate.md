# Selection.Rotate Method (Visio)

Rotates selected shapes either as a group or individually about their pins.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Rotate`( `_Angle_` , `_AngleUnitsNameOrCode_` , `_BlastGuards_` , `_RotationType_` , `_PinX_` , `_PinY_` , `_PinUnitsNameOrCode_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Selection](./Visio.Selection.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Angle_|Required| **Double**|Specifies the angle to rotate the selection. See Remarks for possible values.|
| _AngleUnitsNameOrCode_|Optional| **Variant**|Specifies the units to use for  _Angle_. See Remarks for possible values. The default is degrees.|
| _BlastGuards_|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** to override formulas in the ShapeSheet of any of the selected shapes to which the GUARD function has been applied; **False** to leave guarded formulas unchanged. The default is **False**.|
| _RotationType_|Optional| **VisRotationTypes**|Specifes how the selection is to be rotated. See Remarks for possible values.|
| _PinX_|Optional| **Double**|When  _RotationType_ is **visRotateSelectionWithPin** , specifies the X-position of the pin about which the selection is to be rotated.|
| _PinY_|Optional| **Double**| When _RotationType_ is **visRotateSelectionWithPin** , specifies the Y-position of the pin about which the selection is to be rotated.|
| _PinUnitsNameOrCode_|Optional| **Variant**|Specifies the units to use for  _PinX_ and _PinY_. See Remarks for possible values. The default is inches.|

## Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

The following possible values for  _RotationType_ are declared in **VisRotationTypes** in the Visio type library.



|Constant|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visRotateSelectionWithPin**|1|Rotates the selection around a pin.|
| **visRotateSelection**|0|Rotates the selection relative to the center of the selection.|
| **visRotateShapes**|2|Rotates the selected shapes around their pins relative to their current angle.|

Passing  **True** for the optional _BlastGuards_ argument overrides formulas in the ShapeSheet of any of the selected shapes to which the GUARD function has been applied.

The default value for  _RotationType_ is **visRotateSelection**.

You can specify  _AngleUnitsNameOrCode_ or _PinUnitsNameOrCode_ as an integer (a member of **[VisUnitCodes](Visio.visunitcodes.md)**) or a string value such as "radians" or "inches". If the string is invalid or the unit code is inappropriate (nontextual), an error is generated.

For a complete list of valid unit strings along with corresponding Automation constants (integer values), see [About units of measure](../visio/Concepts/about-units-of-measure-visio.md).


## Example

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **Rotate** method to rotate a selection 45 degrees relative to the center of the selection.


```vb
Public Sub Rotate_Example() 
 
 Dim vsoShape1 As Visio.Shape 
 Dim vsoShape2 As Visio.Shape 
 
 Set vsoShape1 = Application.ActiveWindow.Page.DrawRectangle(1, 9, 3, 7) 
 Set vsoShape2 = Application.ActiveWindow.Page.DrawRectangle(3, 6, 5, 5) 
 
 ActiveWindow.DeselectAll 
 
 ActiveWindow.Select vsoShape1, visSelect 
 ActiveWindow.Select vsoShape2, visSelect 
 
 Application.ActiveWindow.Selection.Rotate 45, visDegrees 
 
End Sub
```
