Set firstRect = s.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 100, 50, 200, 100)
Set secondRect = s.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 300, 300, 200, 100)

lastsite = secondRect.ConnectionSiteCount

With s.AddConnector(msoConnectorCurve, 0, 0, 100, 100) _
        .ConnectorFormat

    .BeginConnect ConnectedShape:=firstRect, ConnectionSite:=1
    .EndConnect ConnectedShape:=secondRect, ConnectionSite:=1

End With

With s.AddConnector(msoConnectorCurve, 0, 0, 100, 100) _
        .ConnectorFormat
