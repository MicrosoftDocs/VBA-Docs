# DropLines Object (Excel)

Represents the drop lines in a chart group.


## Remarks

Drop lines connect the points in the chart with the x-axis. Only line and area chart groups can have drop lines. This object isn't a collection. There's no object that represents a single drop line; you either have drop lines turned on for all points in a chart group or you have them turned off.

If the  **[HasDropLines](Excel.ChartGroup.HasDropLines.md)** property is **False** , most properties of the **DropLines** object are disabled.


## Example

Use the  **DropLines** property to return the **DropLines** object. The following example turns on drop lines for chart group one in embedded chart one and then sets the drop line color to red.


```vb
Worksheets("sheet1").ChartObjects(1).Activate 
ActiveChart.ChartGroups(1).HasDropLines = True 
ActiveChart.ChartGroups(1).DropLines.Border.ColorIndex = 3
```
