# WebBrowserControl.NavigateError event (Access)

Occurs when an error occurs during navigation.


## Syntax

_expression_. `NavigateError`( ` _pDisp_`, ` _URL_`, ` _TargetFrameName_`, ` _StatusCode_`, ` _Cancel_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [WebBrowserControl](Access.WebBrowserControl.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _pDisp_|Required|**Object**|A pointer to an  **IDispatch** interface for the WebBrowser object that represents the window or frame in which the navigation error occurred.|
| _URL_|Required|**Variant**|Contains the URL for which navigation failed.|
| _TargetFrameName_|Required|**Variant**|Contains the name of the frame in which to display the resource, or  **NULL** if no named frame was targeted for the resource.|
| _StatusCode_|Required|**Variant**|Contains an error status code, if available.|
| _Cancel_|Required|**Boolean**|Specifies whether to cancel the navigation to an error page or to any further autosearch.|

## Return value

nothing


## Remarks

This event fires before the  **WebBrowser** control displays an error page due to an error in navigation. You can stop the display of the error page by setting the _Cancel_ parameter to **True**. However, if the server contacted in the original navigation supplies its own substitute page navigation, when you set _Cancel_ to **True**, it has no effect, and the navigation to the server's alternate page proceeds. For example, assume that a navigation to https://www.www.wingtiptoys.com/BigSale.htm causes this event to fire because the page does not exist. However, the server is set to redirect the navigation to https://www.www.wingtiptoys.com/home.htm. In this case, when you set _Cancel_ to **True**, it has no effect, and navigation proceeds to https://www.www.wingtiptoys.com/home.htm.
