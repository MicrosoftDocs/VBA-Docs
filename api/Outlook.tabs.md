# Tabs Object (Outlook Forms Script)

Represents all the  **[Tab](Outlook.tab.md)** controls of a **[TabStrip](Outlook.tabstrip.md)**.


## Remarks

Each  **Tabs** collection provides the features to manage the number of tabs in the collection and to identify the tab that is currently in use.

The default value of the  **Tabs** collection identifies the current **Tab** of a collection.

You can reference a  **Tab** by its index value. The index value reflects the ordinal position of the **Tab** within the collection. The index of the first **Tab** in a collection is 0; the index of the second **Tab** is 1; and so on.
