# OLEDBError object (Excel)

Represents an OLE DB error returned by the most recent OLE DB query.


## Remarks

 The **OLEDBError** object is a member of the **[OLEDBErrors](Excel.OLEDBErrors.md)** collection. If the specified OLE DB query runs without error, the **OLEDBErrors** collection is empty. The errors in the collection are indexed in the order in which they're generated by the OLE DB provider.


## Example

Use  **[OLEDBErrors](Excel.Application.ODBCErrors.md)** ( _index_ ), where _index_ is the index number of the OLE DB error, to return a single **OLEDBError** object. The following example displays the error description and the **[SqlState](Excel.OLEDBError.SqlState.md)** property's value for the first error returned by the most recent OLE DB query.


```vb
Set objEr = Application.OLEDBErrors(1) 
MsgBox "The following error occurred:" & _ 
 objEr.ErrorString & " : " & objEr.SqlState
```
