# ThreeDFormat.ResetRotation method (Word)

Resets the extrusion rotation around the x-axis and the y-axis to 0 (zero) so that the front of the extrusion faces forward.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ResetRotation`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[ThreeDFormat](Word.ThreeDFormat.md)' object.


## Remarks

To set the extrusion rotation around the x-axis and the y-axis to anything other than 0 (zero), use the **RotationX** and **RotationY** properties of the **ThreeDFormat** object. To set the extrusion rotation around the z-axis, use the **Rotation** property of the **Shape** object that represents the extruded shape.


> [!NOTE] 
> This method does not reset the rotation around the z-axis.


## Example

This example resets the rotation around the x-axis and the y-axis to 0 (zero) for the extrusion of the first shape on the active document.


```vb
ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).ThreeD.ResetRotation
```
