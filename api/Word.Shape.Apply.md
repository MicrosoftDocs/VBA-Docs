## Syntax

_expression_.**Apply**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Shape](Word.Shape.md)** object.

If formatting for the **Shape** object has not previously been copied using the **PickUp** method, using the **Apply** method generates an error.


## Example

 .Shapes(1).PickUp 
 .Shapes(2).Apply 
End With
```
