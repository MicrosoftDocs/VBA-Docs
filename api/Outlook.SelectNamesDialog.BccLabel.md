# SelectNamesDialog.BccLabel Property (Outlook)

Returns or sets a **String** for the text that appears on the **Bcc** command button on the **Select Names** dialog box. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `BccLabel`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [SelectNamesDialog](./Outlook.SelectNamesDialog.md) object.


## Remarks

To provide an accelerator key for the recipient edit boxes, include an ampersand (&) character in the label argument string, immediately before the character that serves as the access key. For example, if **BccLabel** is the string "Local & Attendees", users can press **ALT+A** to move the focus to the first recipient edit box.

If **BccLabel** is not set, then the default value will be the localized string for "Bcc". If the **BccLabel** is set to an empty string, then the **Bcc** command button shows **-&gt;**. If the **BccLabel** property contains more than 32 characters (including the ampersand (&) access key), only the first 32 characters will be displayed in the command button.
