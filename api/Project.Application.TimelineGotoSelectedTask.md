# Application.TimelineGotoSelectedTask method (Project)

When a task is selected in the Timeline view,  **TimelineGotoSelectedTask** selects the same task in the main view.


## Syntax

_expression_. `TimelineGotoSelectedTask`

 _expression_ An expression that returns an **[Application](Project.Application.md)** object.


## Return value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks

The **TimelineGotoSelectedTask** method corresponds to the **Go to Selected Task** command on the option menu in the Timeline view. After you run the **TimelineGotoSelectedTask** method, the Timeline view remains the active view.

If a single task is not selected in the Timeline view, or if the Timeline view is not active, the **TimelineGotoSelectedTask** method results in run-time error 1100, "The method is not available in this situation."
