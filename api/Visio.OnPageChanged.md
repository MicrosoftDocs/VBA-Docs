# Viewer.OnPageChanged Event (Visio Viewer)

Occurs when the active page is changed in Microsoft Visio Viewer.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **OnPageChanged**(**_PageIndex_**)

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Viewer** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|PageIndex|Required| **Long**|The index of the new page.|

## Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

The collection of pages in the Viewer is one-based, so the index of the first page in the collection is 1. 

You can change the page programmatically in Visio Viewer by setting the value of the  **[CurrentPageIndex](Visio.CurrentPageIndex.md)** property.


## Example

The following code shows how to use the  **OnPageChanged** event to print a message in the **Immediate** window stating that the page has changed and identifying the new page.


```vb
Private Sub vsoViewer_OnPageChanged(ByVal PageIndex As Long)



    Debug.Print "Page changed to"; vsoViewer.CurrentPageIndex

    

End Sub
```
