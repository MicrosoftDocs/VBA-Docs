## Remarks

As an example, if the object was created in Microsoft Word, this property returns 1297307460, which represents the string "MSWD"; in Microsoft Excel, this property returns 1480803660. This value can also be represented by the constant  **wdCreatorCode** in Word, or **xlCreatorCode** in Excel. The **Creator** property was primarily designed to be used on the Macintosh, where each application has a four-character creator code. For example, Microsoft Word has the creator code MSWD. For additional information about this property, consult the language reference Help included with Microsoft Office Macintosh Edition.

The  **Creator** property always returns the numeric identifier for the active application, just as the **Application** property always returns the name of the active applicatin in string form. Used the **CreatedBy** property of the **SharedWorkspaceFolder** object to return the name of the individual who created the object. Use document properties to return information about the authors of Office documents.
