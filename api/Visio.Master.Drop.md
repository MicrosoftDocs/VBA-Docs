# Master.Drop method (Visio)

Creates one or more new **Shape** objects by dropping an object onto a receiving object such as a master, drawing page, shape, or group.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Drop** (_ObjectToDrop_, _xPos_, _yPos_)

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Master](Visio.Master.md)** object.


## Parameters

|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _ObjectToDrop_|Required| **[UNKNOWN]**|The object or selection to drop. While this is typically a Visio object such as a  **Master**, **Shape**, or **Selection** object, it can be any OLE object that provides an **IDataObject** interface.|
| _xPos_|Required| **Double**|The x-coordinate at which to place the center of the shape's width or PinX.|
| _yPos_|Required| **Double**|The y-coordinate at which to place the center of the shape's height or PinY.|

## Return value

Shape


## Remarks

Using the  **Drop** method is similar to moving a shape with the mouse. The object dropped ( _ObjectToDrop_) can be a master or a shape on the drawing page.

To add a shape to a group or on a drawing page, apply the  **Drop** method to a **Shape** or **Page** object, respectively. The center of the shape's width-height box is positioned at the specified coordinates, and a **Shape** object that represents the shape that is created is returned. When applying this method to a **Shape** object, make sure that the **Shape** object represents a group.

If  _ObjectToDrop_ is a **Master**, the pin of the master is dropped at the specified coordinates. A master's pin is often, but not necessarily, at its center of rotation.
