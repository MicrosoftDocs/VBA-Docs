# MeetingItem.OriginatorDeliveryReportRequested property (Outlook)

Returns or sets a **Boolean** value that determines whether the originator of the meeting item or mail message will receive a delivery report. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `OriginatorDeliveryReportRequested`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [MeetingItem](Outlook.MeetingItem.md) object.


## Remarks

Each transport provider that handles your message sends you a single delivery notification containing the names and addresses of each recipient to whom it was delivered. Delivery does not imply that the message has been read.  **True** if the originator requested a delivery receipt on the message.

The **OriginatorDeliveryReportRequested** property corresponds to the MAPI property **PidTagOriginatorDeliveryReportRequested**.
