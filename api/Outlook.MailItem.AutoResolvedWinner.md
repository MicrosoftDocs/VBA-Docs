# MailItem.AutoResolvedWinner property (Outlook)

Returns a **Boolean** that determines if the item is a winner of an automatic conflict resolution. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AutoResolvedWinner`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [MailItem](Outlook.MailItem.md) object.


## Remarks

A value of  **False** does not necessarily indicate that the item is a loser of an automatic conflict resolution. The item could be in conflict with another item.

If an item has  **[Conflicts.Count](Outlook.Conflicts.Count.md)** of its **[MailItem.Conflicts](Outlook.MailItem.Conflicts.md)** property greater than zero and if its **AutoResolvedWinner** property is **True**, it is a winner of an automatic conflict resolution. On the other hand, if the item is in conflict and has its **AutoResolvedWinner** property as **False**, it is a loser in an automatic conflict resolution.


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example used the  **AutoResolvedWinner** property to determine if an item is a winner or loser in an automatic conflict resolution. To run this example, make sure an email item is open in the active window.


```vb
Sub ConflictStatus() 
 
 Dim mail As Outlook.MailItem 
 
 Set mail = Application.ActiveInspector.CurrentItem 
 
 If mail.Conflicts.Count > 0 Then 
 
 If mail.AutoResolvedWinner = True Then 
 
 MsgBox "This item is a winner in an automatic conflict resolution." 
 
 Else 
 
 MsgBox "This item is a loser in an automatic conflict resolution." 
 
 End If 
 
 Else 
 
 MsgBox "This item is not in conflict with any item." 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
