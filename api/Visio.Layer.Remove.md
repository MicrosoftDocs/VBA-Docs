# Layer.Remove Method (Visio)

Removes a shape from a layer.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Remove`( `_SheetObject_` , `_fPresMems_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Layer](./Visio.Layer.md) object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _SheetObject_|Required| **[IVSHAPE]**|An expression that returns the  **Shape** object to remove.|
| _fPresMems_|Required| **Integer**|Flag that indicates whether to remove members of a group.|

### Return value

Nothing


## Remarks

If the shape is a group and  _fPresMems_ is non-zero, member shapes of the group are unaffected. If _fPresMems_ is zero (0), the group's member shapes are also removed from the layer.
