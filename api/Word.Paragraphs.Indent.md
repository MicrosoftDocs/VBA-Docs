# Paragraphs.Indent method (Word)

Indents one or more paragraphs by one level.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Indent`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Paragraphs](Word.paragraphs.md)' collection.


## Remarks

This method is equivalent to clicking the **Increase Indent** button on the **Formatting** toolbar.


## Example

This example indents all the paragraphs in the active document twice, and then it removes one level of the indent for the first paragraph.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Paragraphs 
 .Indent 
 .Indent 
End With 
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Outdent
```
