# Selection.CopyFormat method (Word)

Copies the character formatting of the first character in the selected text.


## Syntax

_expression_. `CopyFormat`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Selection](Word.Selection.md)** object.


## Remarks

If a paragraph mark is selected, Word copies paragraph formatting in addition to character formatting. You can apply the copied formatting to another selection by using the **[PasteFormat](Word.Selection.PasteFormat.md)** method.


## Example

This example copies the formatting of the first paragraph to the second paragraph in the active document.


```vb
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range.Select 
Selection.CopyFormat 
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(2).Range.Select 
Selection.PasteFormat
```

This example collapses the selection and copies its character formatting to the next word.




```vb
With Selection 
 .Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseStart 
 .CopyFormat 
 .Next(Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1).Select 
 .PasteFormat 
End With
```
