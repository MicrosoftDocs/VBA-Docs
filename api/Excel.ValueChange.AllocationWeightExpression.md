# ValueChange.AllocationWeightExpression property (Excel)

Returns the MDX weight expression to use for this value when performing what-if analysis. Read-only


## Syntax

_expression_. `AllocationWeightExpression`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[ValueChange](Excel.ValueChange.md)' object.


## Return value

 **String**


## Remarks

The  **AllocationWeightExpression** property corresponds to the **Weight Expression** setting in the **What-If Analysis Settings** dialog box for a PivotTable report based on an OLAP data source as it was set at the time that this change was originally applied. If the specified **ValueChange** object was created by using the **[Add](Excel.PivotTableChangeList.Add.md)** method of the **[PivotTableChangeList](Excel.PivotTableChangeList.md)** collection and the corresponding _AllocationWeightExpression_ parameter was not supplied, the default weight expression of the OLAP server is returned.
