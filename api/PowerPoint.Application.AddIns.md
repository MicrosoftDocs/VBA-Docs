# Application.AddIns property (PowerPoint)

Returns the program-specific  **AddIns** collection that represents all the add-ins listed in the **Add-Ins** dialog box (click the **Office** button, click **PowerPoint Options**, click  **Add-Ins**, click  **PowerPoint Add-Ins** on the **Manage** list). Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AddIns`

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Application](PowerPoint.Application.md)** object.


## Remarks

Microsoft Office PowerPoint-specific add-ins are identified by a .ppa or .ppam file name extension. Component Object Model (COM) add-ins can be used universally across Microsoft programming products and have a .dll or .exe file name extension.

For information about returning a single member of a collection, see [Returning an object from a collection](../powerpoint/How-to/return-objects-from-collections.md).


## Example

This example adds the add-in named "Myaddin.ppa" to the list in the  **Add-Ins** dialog box and loads the add-in automatically.


```vb
Set myAddIn = Application.AddIns.Add(FileName:="c:\myaddin.ppa")

myAddIn.Loaded = True

MsgBox myAddIn.Name & " has been added to the list"


```
