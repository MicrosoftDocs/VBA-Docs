# Font.Italic Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a **Boolean** that specifies whether text is normal or italic. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Italic**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **Font** object.


## Remarks

 **True** to indicate that the text with this font is italic, **False** otherwise.

The font's appearance on screen and in print may differ, depending on your computer and printer. If you select a font that your system can't display with the specified attribute or that isn't installed, Windows substitutes a similar font. The substitute font will be as similar as possible to the font originally requested.
