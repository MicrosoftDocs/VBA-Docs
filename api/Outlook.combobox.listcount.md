# ComboBox.ListCount Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns a **Long** that represents the number of list entries in a control. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_.**ListCount**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

 **ListCount** is the number of rows over which you can scroll. **ListCount** is always one greater than the largest value for the **[ListIndex](Outlook.combobox.listindex.md)** property, because index numbers begin with 0 and the count of items begins with 1. If no item is selected, **ListCount** is 0 and **ListIndex** is -1.
