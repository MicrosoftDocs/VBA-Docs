# Shape.LockAnchor property (Word)

 **True** if the anchor of a **Shape** object is locked to the anchoring range. Read/write **Long**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `LockAnchor`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Shape](Word.Shape.md)** object.


## Remarks

When a shape has a locked anchor, you cannot move the shape's anchor by dragging it. The anchor does not move as the shape is moved. A **Shape** object is anchored to a range of text, but you can position it anywhere on the page. The shape is anchored to the beginning of the first paragraph that contains the anchoring range. A shape will always remain on the same page as its anchor.


## Example

This example creates a new document, adds a shape to it, and then locks the shape's anchor.


```vb
Set myDoc = Documents.Add 
Set myShape = myDoc.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeBalloon, _ 
 100, 100, 140, 70) 
myShape.LockAnchor = True 
ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.ShowObjectAnchors = True
```

This example returns a message that states the lock status for each shape in the active document.




```vb
For x = 1 to ActiveDocument.Shapes.Count 
 Msgbox "Shape " & x & " is locked - " _ 
 & ActiveDocument.Shapes(x).LockAnchor 
Next x
```
