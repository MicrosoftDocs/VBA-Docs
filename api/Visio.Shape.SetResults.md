# Shape.SetResults Method (Visio)

Sets the results or formulas of one or more cells.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `SetResults`( `_SRCStream()_` , `_UnitsNamesOrCodes()_` , `_resultArray()_` , `_Flags_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Shape](./Visio.Shape.md) object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _SID_SRCStream()_|Required| **Integer**|An array identifying cells to be modified.|
| _UnitsNamesOrCodes()_|Required| **Variant**|Measurement units to be attributed to entries in results array.|
| _resultArray()_|Required| **Variant**|Out parameter. Results or formulas to be assigned to identified cells.|
| _Flags_|Required| **Integer**|Flags that influence the behavior of  **SetResults** .|

### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks

The  **SetResults** method is like the **Result** method of a **Cell** object, except that it can be used to set the results (values) of many cells at once, rather than one cell at a time.

For  **Shape** objects, you can use the **SetResults** method to set results of any set of cells. You tell the **SetResults** method which cells you want to set by passing an array of integers in _SID_SRCStream()_.  _SID_SRCStream()_ is a one-dimensional array of 2-byte integers.

For  **Shape** objects, _SID_SRCStream()_ should be a one-dimensional array of 3 _n_ 2-byte integers for _n_ >= 1. The **SetResults** method interprets the stream as:




```vb
{sectionIdx, rowIdx, cellIdx }n
```

where  _sectionIdx_ is the section index of the desired cell, _rowIdx_ is its row index, and _cellIdx_ is its cell index.

The  _UnitsNamesOrCodes()_ array controls what measurement units individual entries in results are in. Each entry in the array can be a string such as "inches", "inch", "in.", or "i". Strings may be used for all supported Microsoft Office Visio units such as centimeters, meters, miles, and so on. You can also indicate desired units with integer constants (**visCentimeters** , **visInches** , and so on) declared by the Visio type library in **VisUnitCodes** . For a list of constants used for units of measure, see [About Units of Measure](../visio/Concepts/about-units-of-measure-visio.md). Note that the values specified in the  _UnitsNamesOrCodes()_ array have no effect if **visSetFormulas** is set in _Flags_.

If  _UnitsNamesOrCodes()_ is not empty, we expect it to be a one-dimensional array of 1 <= _u_ variants. Each entry can be a string or integer code, or empty (nothing). If the _i_ 'th entry is empty, the _i_ 'th entry in _resultArray_ is in the units designated by _UnitsNamesOrCodes()_ _(j)_ , where _j_ is the most recent prior entry that is not empty. Thus, if you want all entries in _resultArray_ to be interpreted in the same units, you need only pass a _UnitsNamesOrCodes()_ array that has one entry. If there is no prior entry that is not empty, or if no _UnitsNamesOrCodes()_ array is supplied, **visNumber** (0x20) will be used. This causes the application to default to internal units (as does the **ResultIU** property of a **Cell** object).

The  _resultArray()_ parameter should be a one-dimensional array of 1 <= _m_ variants. A result can be passed as **Double** , **Integer** , **String** , or a reference to a **String** . Strings are accepted only if **visSetFormulas** is set in _Flags_, in which case strings are interpreted as formulas. If  _resultArray(i)_ is empty, the _i_ 'th cell will be set to the value in _resultArray(j)_, where  _j_ is the index of the most recent prior entry that is not empty. If there is no prior entry that is not empty, the corresponding cell is not altered. If fewer results than cells are specified (if _m < n_ ), the _i_ 'th cell, _i < m_ , will be set to the same value as the _m_ 'th cell. Thus, to set many cells to the same value, you need only pass one copy of the value.

The  _Flags_ parameter should be a bitmask of the following values.



|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visSetFormulas**|&;H1|Treat strings in results as formulas.|
| **visSetBlastGuards**|&;H2|Override present cell values even if they're guarded.|
| **visSetTestCircular**|&;H4|Test for establishment of circular cell references.|
| **visSetUniversalSyntax**|&;H8|Formulas are in universal syntax|

The value returned by the  **SetResults** method is the number of entries in _SID_SRCStream()_ that were successfully processed. If _i < n_ entries are processed correctly, but an error occurs on the _i_ + 1st entry, the **SetResults** method raises an exception and returns _i_ . Otherwise, _n_ is returned.


## Example

The following example shows how to use the  **SetResults** method. This example assumes there is an active page that has at least 3 shapes on it. It uses the **GetResults** method to get the width of shape 1, the height of shape 2, and the angle of shape 3. It then uses **SetResults** to set the width of shape 1 to the height of shape 2 and the height of shape 2 to the width of shape 1.The angle of shape 3 is left unaltered.

This example uses the  **GetResults** method of the **Page** object to get 3 cell formulas and the **SetResults** method of the same object to set the formulas. The input array has 4 slots for each cell, as it also would for **Master** objects. For **Shape** or **Style** objects, only 3 slots are needed for each cell (section, row, and cell).
