# TaskItem.AttachmentAdd event (Outlook)

Occurs when an attachment has been added to an instance of the parent object.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AttachmentAdd`( `_Attachment_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents a [TaskItem](Outlook.TaskItem.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Attachment_|Required| **[Attachment](Outlook.Attachment.md)**|The **Attachment** that was added to the item.|

## Example

This Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example checks the size of the item after an attachment has been added and displays a warning if the size exceeds 500,000 bytes. The sample code must be placed in a class module such as  `ThisOutlookSession`, and the  `TestAttachAdd()` procedure should be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```vb
Public WithEvents newItem As Outlook.MailItem 
 
 
 
Private Sub newItem_AttachmentAdd(ByVal newAttachment As Attachment) 
 
 If newAttachment.Type = olByValue Then 
 
 newItem.Save 
 
 If newItem.Size > 500000 Then 
 
 MsgBox "Warning: Item size is now " & newItem.Size & " bytes." 
 
 End If 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Public Sub TestAttachAdd() 
 
 Dim atts As Outlook.Attachments 
 
 Dim newAttachment As Outlook.Attachment 
 
 
 
 Set newItem = Application.CreateItem(olMailItem) 
 
 newItem.Subject = "Test attachment" 
 
 Set atts = newItem.Attachments 
 
 Set newAttachment = atts.Add("C:\Test.txt", olByValue) 
 
End Sub
```
