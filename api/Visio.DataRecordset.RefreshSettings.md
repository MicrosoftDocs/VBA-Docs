# DataRecordset.RefreshSettings Property (Visio)

Gets and sets options that determine how the data recordset is refreshed. Read/write.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `RefreshSettings`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [DataRecordset](./Visio.DataRecordset.md) object.


## Return value

Long


## Remarks

Constants for how a data recordset is refreshed are declared in the  **VisRefreshSettings** enumeration in the Visio type library:



|Constant|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visRefreshNoReconciliationUI**|2|Disables the  **Refresh Conflicts** task pane in the Visio user interface (UI) after a refresh operation.|
| **visRefreshOverwriteAll**|1|When data is refreshed, overwrites all user changes made in the shape data of shapes linked to data in this recordset since the previous refresh operation. See note.|

The default is for neither of the  **VisRefreshSettings** flags to be turned on. (**RefreshSettings** = 0).

When  **visRefreshNoReconciliationUI** is set, support for reconciling refresh conflicts in the Visio UI is disabled. As a developer, you should reconcile refresh conflicts programmatically by using the **[GetAllRefreshConflicts](Visio.DataRecordset.GetAllRefreshConflicts.md)** , **[GetMatchingRowsForRefreshConflict](Visio.DataRecordset.GetMatchingRowsForRefreshConflict.md)** , and **[RemoveRefreshConflict](Visio.DataRecordset.RemoveRefreshConflict.md)** methods.


 **Note**  In some previous versions of Visio, shape data was called custom properties.
