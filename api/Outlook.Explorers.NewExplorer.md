# Explorers.NewExplorer event (Outlook)

Occurs whenever a new explorer window is opened, either as a result of user action or through program code. 


## Syntax

_expression_. `NewExplorer`( `_Explorer_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Explorers](Outlook.Explorers.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Explorer_|Required| **[Explorer](Outlook.Explorer.md)**|The explorer that was opened.|

## Remarks

This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).

The event occurs after the new **[Explorer](Outlook.Explorer.md)** object is created but before the explorer window appears.


## Example

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example minimizes the currently active explorer window when a new explorer is about to appear. The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the  `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```vb
Public WithEvents myOlExplorers As Outlook.Explorers 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myOlExplorers = Application.Explorers 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlExplorers_NewExplorer(ByVal Explorer As Outlook.Explorer) 
 
 If TypeName(Application.ActiveExplorer) <> "Nothing" Then 
 
 Application.ActiveExplorer.WindowState = olMinimized 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
