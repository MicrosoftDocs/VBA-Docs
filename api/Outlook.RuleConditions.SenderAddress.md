# RuleConditions.SenderAddress property (Outlook)

Returns an **[AddressRuleCondition](Outlook.AddressRuleCondition.md)** object with an **[AddressRuleCondition.ConditionType](Outlook.AddressRuleCondition.ConditionType.md)** of **olConditionSenderAddress**. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `SenderAddress`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [RuleConditions](Outlook.RuleConditions.md) object.


## Remarks

Use the returned  **AddressRuleCondition** object when enumerating the rule conditions or exception conditions of an existing rule, or when creating a new rule that specifies the condition or exception condition that the sender address contains the specified text.

This property of the  **[RuleConditions](Outlook.RuleConditions.md)** collection always returns a **AddressRuleCondition** object regardless of whether the rule associated with this **RuleConditions** collection has defined such a rule condition. If the rule has defined and enabled such a rule condition, then **[AddressRuleCondition.Enabled](Outlook.AddressRuleCondition.Enabled.md)** will be **True**.
