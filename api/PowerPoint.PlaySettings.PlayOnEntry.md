# PlaySettings.PlayOnEntry Property (PowerPoint)

Determines whether the specified movie or sound is played automatically when it is animated. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `PlayOnEntry`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [PlaySettings](./PowerPoint.PlaySettings.md) object.


## Return value

MsoTriState


## Remarks

Setting this property to  **msoTrue** sets the **[Animate](PowerPoint.AnimationSettings.Animate.md)** property of the **AnimationSettings** object to **msoTrue**. Setting the **Animate** property to **msoFalse** automatically sets the **PlayOnEntry** property to **msoFalse**.

Use the  **[ActionVerb](PowerPoint.ActionSetting.ActionVerb.md)** property to set the verb that will be invoked when the media clip is animated.

The value of the  **PlayOnEntry** property can be one of these **MsoTriState** constants.



|Constant|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|**msoFalse**|The specified movie or sound is not played automatically when it is animated.|
|**msoTrue**| The specified movie or sound is played automatically when it is animated.|

Set OLEobj = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(3)

OLEobj.AnimationSettings.PlaySettings.PlayOnEntry = msoTrue
