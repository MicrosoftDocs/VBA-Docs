# OptionButton.Caption Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a **String** that appears on an object to identify or describe it. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Caption**

_expression_ A variable that represents an **OptionButton** object.


## Remarks

The default caption for a control is a unique name based on the type of control. For example, CommandButton1 is the default caption for the first command button in a form.

If a control's caption is too long, the caption is truncated. If a form's caption is too long for the title bar, the title is displayed with an ellipsis.

The **[ForeColor](Outlook.optionbutton.forecolor.md)** property of the control determines the color of the text in the caption.

Setting  **[AutoSize](Outlook.optionbutton.autosize.md)** to **True** automatically adjusts the size of the control to frame the entire caption.
