# Selection.LtrPara method (Word)

Sets the reading order and alignment of the specified paragraphs to left-to-right.


## Syntax

_expression_. `LtrPara`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Selection](Word.Selection.md)** object.


## Remarks

For all selected paragraphs, this method sets the reading order to left-to-right. If a paragraph with a right-to-left reading order is also right-aligned, this method reverses its reading order and sets its paragraph alignment to left-aligned.

Use the **ReadingOrder** property to change the reading order without affecting paragraph alignment.


## Example

This example sets the reading order and alignment of the current selection to left-to-right if the selection is styled as "Normal."


```vb
If Selection.Style = "Normal" Then _ 
 Selection.LtrPara
```
