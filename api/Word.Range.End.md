# Range.End property (Word)

Returns or sets the ending character position of a range. Read/write  **Long**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `End`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[Range](Word.Range.md)' object.


## Remarks

 **Range** objects all have a starting position and an ending position. The ending position is the point farthest away from the beginning of the story. If this property is set to a value smaller than the **[Start](Word.Range.Start.md)** property, the **Start** property is set to the same value (that is, the **Start** and **End** property are equal).

This property returns the ending character position relative to the beginning of the story. The main document story (**wdMainTextStory**) begins with character position 0 (zero). You can change the size of a selection, range, or bookmark by setting this property.


## Example

This example changes the ending position of myRange by one character.


```vb
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range 
myRange.End = myRange.End - 1
```
