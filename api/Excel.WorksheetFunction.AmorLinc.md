## Remarks

If an asset is purchased in the middle of the accounting period, the prorated depreciation is taken into account.

The following table describes values used for  _Arg7_ .



|**Basis**|**Date system**|
|:-----|:-----|
|0 or omitted|360 days (NASD method)|
|1|Actual|
|3|365 days in a year|
|4|360 days in a year (European method)|

 **Important**  Dates should be entered by using the DATE function, or as results of other formulas or functions. For example, use DATE(2008,5,23) for the 23rd day of May, 2008. Problems can occur if dates are entered as text.

Microsoft Excel stores dates as sequential serial numbers so they can be used in calculations. By default, January 1, 1900 is serial number 1, and January 1, 2008 is serial number 39448 because it is 39,448 days after January 1, 1900. Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh uses a different date system as its default. 


 **Note**  Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) calculates serial dates differently than Excel. In VBA, serial number 1 is December 31, 1899, rather than January 1, 1900.
