# Entity object (Access)

Represents an entity defined in a Data Service data connection.


## Remarks

Use the **[Item](Access.Entities.Item.md)** property of the **[Entities](Access.Entities.md)** collection to return an **Entity** object.

Use the **[Operations](Access.Operations.md)** property to return the operations defined for the specified entity.

A Data Service data connection may contain one or more entities. Each entity specifies an external content type. Used throughout the functionality and services offered by Business Connectivity Services, external content types are reusable metadata descriptions of connectivity information and data definitions plus the behaviors that you want to apply to a certain category of external data. 

For more information about external content types, see [What Are External Content Types](/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee556391(v=office.14)).
