# TaskRequestAcceptItem.Read event (Outlook)

Occurs when an instance of the parent object is opened for editing by the user. 


## Syntax

_expression_. `Read`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [TaskRequestAcceptItem](Outlook.TaskRequestAcceptItem.md) object.


## Remarks

The **Read** event differs from the **[Open](Outlook.TaskRequestAcceptItem.Open.md)** event in that **Read** occurs whenever the user selects the item in a view that supports in-cell editing as well as when the item is being opened in an **[Inspector](Outlook.Inspector.md)**.
