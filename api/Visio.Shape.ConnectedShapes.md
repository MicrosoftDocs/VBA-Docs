# Shape.ConnectedShapes Method (Visio)

Returns an array that contains the identifiers (IDs) of the shapes that are connected to the shape.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ConnectedShapes`( `_Flags_` , `_CategoryFilter_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[Shape](Visio.Shape.md)' object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Flags_|Required| **[VisConnectedShapesFlags](Visio.VisConnectedShapesFlags.md)**|Filters the array of returned shape IDs by the directionality of the connectors. See Remarks for possible values.|
| _CategoryFilter_|Required| **String**|Filters the array of returned shape IDs by limiting it to the IDs of shapes that match the specified category.|

## Return value

 **Long()**


## Remarks

The  _Flags_ value must be one of the following **VisConnectedShapesFlags** constants.



|Constant|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visConnectedShapesAllNodes**|0|Return IDs of shapes that are associated with both incoming and outgoing connections.|
| **visConnectedShapesIncomingNodes**|1|Return IDs of shapes that are associated with incoming connections.|
| **visConnectedShapesOutgoingNodes**|2|Return IDs of shapes that are associated with outgoing connections.|

Categories are user-defined strings that you can use to categorize shapes and thereby to restrict membership in a container. You can define categories in the User.msvShapeCategories cell in the ShapeSheet for a shape. You can define multiple categories for a shape by separating the categories with semi-colons.

If the source object is a 1-D shape or part of a master, the  **ConnectedShapes** method returns an Invalid Source error.

If no qualifying connected shapes exist, the  **ConnectedShapes** method returns an empty array.


## Examples

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **ConnectedShapes** method to find the names of all the shapes at the other end of outgoing connections from a selected shape.
