# PictureFormat.HorizontalScale Property (Publisher)

Returns a  **Long** that represents the scaling of the picture along its horizontal axis. The scaling is expressed as a percentage (for example, 200 equals 200 percent scaling). Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **HorizontalScale**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **PictureFormat** object.


## Return value

Long


## Remarks

The effective resolution of a picture is inversely proportional to the scaling at which the picture is printed. The larger the scaling, the lower the effective resolution. For example, suppose a picture measuring 4 inches by 4 inches was originally scanned at 300 dpi. If that picture is scaled to 2 inches by 2 inches, its effective resolution is 600 dpi.

Use the  **[EffectiveResolution](Publisher.PictureFormat.EffectiveResolution.md)** property of the **[PictureFormat](Publisher.PictureFormat.md)** object to determine the resolution at which the picture or OLE object will print in the specified document.


## Example

The following example prints selected image properties for each picture in the active publication.


```vb
Dim pgLoop As Page 
Dim shpLoop As Shape 
 
For Each pgLoop In ActiveDocument.Pages 
 For Each shpLoop In pgLoop.Shapes 
 If shpLoop.Type = pbPicture Or shpLoop.Type = pbLinkedPicture Then 
 
 With shpLoop.PictureFormat 
 
 If .IsEmpty = msoFalse Then 
 Debug.Print "File Name: " & .Filename 
 Debug.Print "Resolution in Publication: " & .EffectiveResolution & " dpi" 
 Debug.Print "Horizontal Scaling: " & .HorizontalScale & "%" 
 Debug.Print "Height in publication: " & .Height & " points" 
 Debug.Print "Vertical Scaling: " & .VerticalScale & "%" 
 Debug.Print "Width in publication: " & .Width & " points" 
 End If 
 
 End With 
 End If 
 Next shpLoop 
Next pgLoop 
 

```
