# Series.Formula property (Word)

Returns or sets the object's formula in A1-style notation and in the language of the macro. Read/write  **String**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Formula`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[Series](Word.Series.md)' object.


## Remarks

This property is not available for OLAP data sources.

If the object contains a constant, this property returns the constant. If the object is empty, this property returns an empty string. If the object contains a formula, this property returns the formula as a string in the same format that would be displayed in the formula bar (including the equal sign).

If the range is a one- or two-dimensional range, you can set the formula to a Visual Basic array of the same dimensions. Similarly, you can put the formula into a Visual Basic array.
