## Syntax

 _expression_ A variable that represents a  **Shapes** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Type|Required| **PbWebControlType**|Specifies the type of Web form control to add. An error occurs if pbWebControlWebComponent is used.|

|Top|Required| **Variant**|The position of the top edge of the shape representing the Web form control.|
|Width|Required| **Variant**|The width of the shape representing the Web form control. For command buttons, this parameter is ignored.|
|Height|Required| **Variant**|The height of the shape representing the Web form control. For command buttons, this parameter is ignored.|
|LaunchPropertiesWindow|Optional| **Boolean**|Not supported. Default is  **False**; an error occurs if this argument is set to  **True**.|

### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks

For the Left, Top, Width, and Height parameters, numeric values are evaluated in points; strings can be in any units supported by Microsoft Publisher (for example, "2.5 in").

When adding a hot spot to a Web control by using the  **pbWebControlHotSpot** constant, the URL is specified by the **[Hyperlink](Publisher.TextRange.Hyperlinks.md)** property.

 Note that the **Shape.Fill** property, which returns a **FillFormat** object, and the **Shape.Line** property, which returns a **LineFormat** object, cannot be accessed from a hot spot shape. A run-time error is returned if attempting to access these properties from a hot spot shape.

The Type parameter can be one of the  **PbWebControlType** constants declared in the Microsoft Publisher type library and shown in the following table.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **pbWebControlCheckBox**|Adds a check box.|
| **pbWebControlCommandButton**|Adds a command button.|
| **pbWebControlHotSpot**|Adds a hot spot. |
| **pbWebControlHTMLFragment**|Adds an HTML fragment.|
| **pbWebControlListBox**|Adds a list box.|
| **pbWebControlMultiLineTextBox**|Adds a multiple-line text area.|
| **pbWebControlOptionButton**|Adds an option button.|
| **pbWebControlSingleLineTextBox**|Adds a single-line text box.|
| **pbWebControlWebComponent**|Not used for this method.|

## Example

The following example adds a Web form check box control to the first page of the active publication.


```vb
Dim shpCheckBox As Shape 
 
Set shpCheckBox = ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes.AddWebControl _ 
 (Type:=pbWebControlCheckBox, _ 
 Left:=216, Top:=216, _ 
 Width:=18, Height:=18) 

```

The following example adds hot spots to a shape on page four of the active Web publication. First, a four-point star AutoShape is added to the page. Next, a hot spot is added to each arm of the star by using the  **AddWebControl** method with a Type of **pbWebControlHotSpot**. Finally, a hyperlink is added to each hot spot by using the  **Hyperlink** property of each hot spot shape.




```vb
Dim theDoc As Document 
Dim theStar As Shape 
Dim theWC1 As Shape 
Dim theWC2 As Shape 
Dim theWC3 As Shape 
Dim theWC4 As Shape 
 
Set theDoc = ActiveDocument 
Set theStar = theDoc.Pages(4).Shapes.AddShape _ 
 (Type:=msoShape4pointStar, Left:=200, Top:=25, _ 
 Width:=200, Height:=200) 
 
With theDoc.Pages(4).Shapes 
 
 Set theWC1 = .AddWebControl(Type:=pbWebControlHotSpot, _ 
 Left:=280, Top:=25, Width:=40, Height:=80) 
 With theWC1 
 .Hyperlink.Address = "http://www.contoso.com/page1.htm" 
 End With 
 
 Set theWC2 = .AddWebControl(Type:=pbWebControlHotSpot, _ 
 Left:=320, Top:=105, Width:=80, Height:=40) 
 With theWC2 
 .Hyperlink.Address = "http://www.contoso.com/page2.htm" 
 End With 
 
 Set theWC3 = .AddWebControl(Type:=pbWebControlHotSpot, _ 
 Left:=280, Top:=145, Width:=40, Height:=80) 
 With theWC3 
 .Hyperlink.Address = "http://www.contoso.com/page3.htm" 
 End With 
 
 Set theWC4 = .AddWebControl(Type:=pbWebControlHotSpot, _ 
 Left:=200, Top:=105, Width:=80, Height:=40) 
 With theWC4 
 .Hyperlink.Address = "http://www.contoso.com/page4.htm"
