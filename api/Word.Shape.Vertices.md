# Shape.Vertices property (Word)

Returns the coordinates of the specified freeform drawing's vertices (and control points for Bézier curves) as a series of coordinate pairs. Read-only  **Variant**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Vertices**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Shape](Word.Shape.md)** object.


## Remarks

You can use the array returned by this property as an argument for the  **AddCurve** or **AddPolyLine** method.

The following table shows how the  **Vertices** property associates values in the array _vertArray()_ with the coordinates of a triangle's vertices.



|**vertArray element**|**Contains**|
|:-----|:-----|
| `vertArray(1, 1)`|The horizontal distance from the first vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(1, 2)`|The vertical distance from the first vertex to the top of the document.|
|vertArray(2, 1)|The horizontal distance from the second vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(2, 2)`|The vertical distance from the second vertex to the top of the document.|
| `vertArray(3, 1)`|The horizontal distance from the third vertex to the left side of the document.|
| `vertArray(3, 2)`|The vertical distance from the third vertex to the top of the document.|

## Example

This example assigns the vertex coordinates for shape one in the active document to an array variable and displays the coordinates for the first vertex. Shape one must be a freeform drawing.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Shapes(1) 
    vertArray = .Vertices 
    x1 = vertArray(1, 1) 
    y1 = vertArray(1, 2) 
    MsgBox "First vertex coordinates: " & x1 & ", " & y1 
End With
```

This example creates a curve that has the same geometric description as shape one in the active document. This example assumes that the first shape is a Bézier curve containing 3n+1 vertices, where n is the number of curve segments.




```vb
With ActiveDocument.Shapes 
    .AddCurve .Item(1).Vertices, Selection.Range 
End With
```
