## Syntax

_expression_. `ClearCharacterStyle`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **[Selection](Word.Selection.md)** object.

To remove manually applied character formatting, use the **[ClearCharacterDirectFormatting](Word.Selection.ClearCharacterDirectFormatting.md)** method. To remove all character formatting, both style and manual formatting, use the **[ClearCharacterAllFormatting](Word.Selection.ClearCharacterAllFormatting.md)** method.

> To remove paragraph formatting, see the **[ClearParagraphAllFormatting](Word.Selection.ClearParagraphAllFormatting.md)**, **[ClearParagraphDirectFormatting](Word.Selection.ClearParagraphDirectFormatting.md)**, or **[ClearParagraphStyle](Word.Selection.ClearParagraphStyle.md)** method.
