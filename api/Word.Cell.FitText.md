# Cell.FitText property (Word)

 **True** if Microsoft Word visually reduces the size of text typed into a cell so that it fits within the column width. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `FitText`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[Cell](Word.Cell.md)' object.


## Remarks

If the **FitText** property is set to **True**, the font size of the text is not changed, but the visual width of the characters is adjusted to fit all the typed text into the cell.


## Example

This example sets the first cell in the selection to automatically fit typed text within its width.


```vb
Selection.Cells(1).FitText = True
```
