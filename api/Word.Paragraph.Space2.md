# Paragraph.Space2 method (Word)

Double-spaces the specified paragraphs.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Space2`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Paragraph](Word.Paragraph.md)' object.


## Remarks

The exact spacing is determined by adding 12 points to the font size of the largest character in each paragraph.

You can also use the **[LineSpacingRule](Word.Paragraph.LineSpacingRule.md)** property to set the line spacing for a paragraph. The following two statements are equivalent:




```vb
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Space2 
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).LineSpacingRule = wdLineSpaceDouble
```


## Example

This example changes the first paragraph in the selection to double spacing.


```vb
Selection.Paragraphs(1).Space2
```
