# SparklineGroup.Location property (Excel)

Gets or sets the  **[Range](Excel.Range(object).md)** object that represents the location of the sparkline group. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Location`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[SparklineGroup](Excel.SparklineGroup.md)' object.


## Return value

Range


## Remarks

The location for all sparklines in a sparkline group must be on the same sheet, but the source data for the sparkline group can be on a different sheet or workbook.

The size of the range that represents the  **Location** property must equal the number of rows or columns in the **[SourceData](Excel.SparklineGroup.SourceData.md)** property for the **SparklineGroup** object.

A continuous range associated with a sparkline group can only be one dimensional. If the range is not continuous, each cell must be specified individually.


 **Note**  Do not use the  **[Union](Excel.Application.Union.md)** method to create a non-continuous range because the **Union** method returns a single range reference.
