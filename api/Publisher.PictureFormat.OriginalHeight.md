# PictureFormat.OriginalHeight Property (Publisher)

Returns a  **Variant** representing the height, in points, of the specified linked picture or OLE object. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **OriginalHeight**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an  **PictureFormat** object.


## Return value

## Remarks

This property applies only to linked pictures or OLE objects. Returns "Permission Denied" for shapes representing embedded or pasted pictures.

To determine whether a shape represents a linked picture, use either the  **[Type](Publisher.Shape.Type.md)** property of the **[Shape](Publisher.Shape.md)** object, or the **[IsLinked](Publisher.PictureFormat.IsLinked.md)** property of the **[PictureFormat](Publisher.PictureFormat.md)** object.


## Example

The following example tests each picture in the active publication, and returns selected image properties for pictures that are linked.


```vb
Dim pgLoop As Page 
Dim shpLoop As Shape 
 
For Each pgLoop In ActiveDocument.Pages 
 For Each shpLoop In pgLoop.Shapes 
 If shpLoop.Type = pbLinkedPicture Then 
 
 With shpLoop.PictureFormat 
 
 Debug.Print "File Name: " & .Filename 
 Debug.Print "Horizontal Scaling: " & .HorizontalScale & "%" 
 Debug.Print "Original Image Height: " & .OriginalHeight & " points" 
 Debug.Print "Height in publication: " & .Height & " points" 
 
 End With 
 End If 
 Next shpLoop 
Next pgLoop 

```
