# MultiPage Object (Outlook Forms Script)

Presents multiple screens of information as a single set.


## Remarks

A  **MultiPage** is useful when you work with a large amount of information that can be sorted into several categories. For example, use a **MultiPage** to display information from an employment application. One page might contain personal information such as name and address; another page might list previous employers; a third page might list references. The **MultiPage** lets you visually combine related information, while keeping the entire record readily accessible.

New pages are added to the right of the currently selected page rather than adjacent to it.

A  **MultiPage** is a control that contains a collection of one or more pages.

Each  **[Page](Outlook.page.md)** of a **MultiPage** is a form that contains its own controls, and as such, can have a unique layout. Typically, the pages in a **MultiPage** have tabs so the user can select the individual pages.

By default, a  **MultiPage** includes two pages, called Page1 and Page2. Each of these is a **Page** object, and together they represent the **[Pages](Outlook.pages(object).md)** collection of the **MultiPage**. If you add more pages, they become part of the same  **Pages** collection.

The default property for a  **MultiPage** is the **[Value](Outlook.multipage.value.md)** property, which returns the index of the currently active **Page** in the **Pages** collection of the **MultiPage**.

The  **MultiPage** control does not support the **[Click](Outlook.multipage.click.md)** event.
