# Attachment.Position property (Outlook)

Returns or sets a **Long** indicating the position of the attachment within the body of the item. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Position**

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Attachment](Outlook.Attachment.md) object.


## Remarks

The **Position** property only works on an attachment for an item where the body format is Rich Text (RTF). If the body format is not RTF, the **Position** property is ignored for a set operation and always returns zero (0) for a get operation.

If you set the  **Position** property to 0 for an item where the body format is RTF, the attachment will be hidden in Outlook's user interface. The attachment is not visible in a view, and the user cannot remove the attachment from the body of the item. The attachment can still be accessed through the **[Attachments](Outlook.Attachments.md)** collection on the item.

The only item that allows programmatic setting of the  **BodyFormat** property is a **[MailItem](Outlook.MailItem.md)**. Other item types such as Appointment, Contact, and Task are RTF by default.
