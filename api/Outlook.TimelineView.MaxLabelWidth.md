 ' Obtain a TimelineView object reference for the 
 
 ' current timeline view. 
 
 Set objTimelineView = _ 
 
 Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentView 
 
 
 
 ' Configure the TimelineView object so that it displays 
 
 ' Outlook items by month and week, displaying labels 
 
 ' no larger than 40 characters for Outlook items 
 
 ' displayed in the view. 
 
 With objTimelineView 
 
 ' Display items by month. 
 
 .TimelineViewMode = olTimelineViewMonth 
 
 ' Display week numbers. If this value is 
 
 ' set to False when TimelineViewMode is 
 
 ' set to olTimelineViewMonth, the day 
 
 ' numbers are displayed instead. 
 
 .ShowWeekNumbers = True 
 
 ' Display labels for Outlook items

 ' Show no more than the first 40 characters 
 
 ' for each Outlook item in the view.
