# WrapFormat.AllowOverlap property (Word)

Returns or sets a value that specifies whether a given shape can overlap other shapes. Read/write  **Long**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `AllowOverlap`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[WrapFormat](Word.WrapFormat.md)' object.


## Remarks

This property can be set to either  **True** or **False**. Because HTML doesn't support overlapping tables or shapes, **AllowOverlap** is ignored in Web layout view.


## Example

This example specifies that the first shape in the active document can overlap other shapes.


```vb
ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).WrapFormat.AllowOverlap = True
```
