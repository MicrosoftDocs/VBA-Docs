# PivotCell.CellChanged Property (Excel)

Returns whether a PivotTable value cell has been edited or recalculated since the PivotTable report was created or the last commit operation was performed. Read-only


## Syntax

 _expression_. `CellChanged`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a '[PivotCell](Excel.PivotCell.md)' object.


### Return value

 **[XlCellChangedState](Excel.XlCellChangedState.md)**


## Remarks

The value of the  **CellChanged** property is **xlCellNotChanged** by default.

For PivotTable reports with non-OLAP data sources, the value of this property can be only either  **xlCellNotChanged** or **xlCellChanged** . It is **xlCellNotChanged** for cells that have not been edited, and is **xlCellChanged** for cells that have been edited. Discarding changes sets its value to **xlCellNotChanged** .

Applying and saving changes applies only to PivotTable reports with OLAP data sources. The following list of descriptions of the possible states of the  **CellChange** property apply only to PivotTables with OLAP data sources:


-  **xlCellNotChanged** - the cell has not been edited or recalculated (if the cell contains a formula) since the PivotTable was created, or since the last save or discard changes operation was performed.
    
-  **xlCellChanged** - the cell has been edited or recalculated since the PivotTable was created, or since the last apply changes or save changes operation was performed, but that change has not yet been applied (the **UPDATE CUBE** statement has not been run for it).
    
-  **xlCellChangeApplied** - the cell has been edited or recalculated since the PivotTable was created, or since the last apply changes, save changes, or discard changes operation was performed, and that change has been applied (the **UPDATE CUBE** statement has been run for it).
    
The following table lists descriptions of how different actions by the user affect the setting of the  **CellChanged** property in a PivotTable with an OLAP data source.
