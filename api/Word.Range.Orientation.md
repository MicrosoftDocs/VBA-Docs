# Range.Orientation property (Word)

Returns or sets the orientation of text in a range when the Text Direction feature is enabled. Read/write  **WdTextOrientation**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Orientation**

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Range](Word.Range.md)** object.


## Remarks

Some of the **WdTextOrientation** constants may not be available to you, depending on the language support (U.S. English, for example) that you have selected or installed.

You can set the orientation for a text frame or for a range that happens to occur inside a text frame. For information about the difference between a text frame and a text box, see the **TextFrame** object.
