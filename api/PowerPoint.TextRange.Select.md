# TextRange.Select Method (PowerPoint)

## Syntax

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [TextRange](./PowerPoint.TextRange.md) object.

## Example

```vb
ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes.Title.TextFrame _
    .TextRange.Characters(1, 5).Select
```

This example selects slide one in the active presentation.




```vb
ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Select
```

This example selects a table that has been added to a new slide in a new presentation. The table has three rows and three columns.




```vb
With Presentations.Add.Slides

    .Add(1, ppLayoutBlank).Shapes.AddTable(3, 3).Select

End With
```
