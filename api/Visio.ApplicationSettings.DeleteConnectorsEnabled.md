# ApplicationSettings.DeleteConnectorsEnabled Property (Visio)

Determines whether connectors are deleted when a shape to which they are connected is deleted. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `DeleteConnectorsEnabled`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an '[ApplicationSettings](Visio.ApplicationSettings.md)' object.


## Return value

Boolean


## Remarks

The setting of the  **DeleteConnectorsEnabled** property also determines whether two connectors reconnect when a shape to which they are both connected is deleted.

Connectors that contain text are not deleted when shapes to which they are connected are deleted, even if  **DeleteConnectorsEnabled** is **True**.

The setting of the  **DeleteConnectorsEnabled** property corresponds to the setting of the **Delete connectors when deleting shapes** check box under **Editing options** on the **Advanced** tab of the **Visio Options** dialog box. To open the **Visio Options** dialog box, click the **File** tab, click **Options**, and then click  **Advanced**.
