# DataRecordset.TimeRefreshed Property (Visio)

Returns the date and time the data recordset was last refreshed. Read-only.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `TimeRefreshed`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [DataRecordset](./Visio.DataRecordset.md) object.


### Return value

Date


## Remarks

The  **TimeRefreshed** property value is returned in Coordinated Universal Time (Greenwich Mean Time).

If you successfully create a data recordset but it fails to retrieve any data from the data source,  **TimeRefreshed** returns zero.

The first time you execute a query against a data recordset,  **TimeRefreshed** is set to the time the query is executed. If, subsequently, the **[Refresh](Visio.DataRecordset.Refresh.md)** method is called, **TimeRefreshed** is set to the time the data recordset is refreshed.
