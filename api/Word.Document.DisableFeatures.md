# Document.DisableFeatures property (Word)

 **True** disables all features introduced after the version specified in the **[DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfter](Word.Document.DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfter.md)** property. The default value is **False**. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `DisableFeatures`

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Document](Word.Document.md)** object.


## Remarks

The **DisableFeatures** property only affects the document for which you set the property. Use this property if you plan on sharing a document between users with earlier versions of Microsoft Word so that you don't end up introducing into a document features that are not available in their versions.


## Example

This example disables all features added after Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0 and 7.0a, for the current document. The global default setting remains unchanged.


```vb
Sub FeaturesDisable() 
 With ActiveDocument 
 
 'Checks whether features are disabled 
 If .DisableFeatures = True Then 
 
 'If they are, disables all features after Word for Windows 95 
 .DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfter = wd70 
 Else 
 
 'If not, turns on the disable features option and disables 
 'all features introduced after Word for Windows 95 
 .DisableFeatures = True 
 .DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfter = wd70 
 End If 
 End With 
End Sub
```
