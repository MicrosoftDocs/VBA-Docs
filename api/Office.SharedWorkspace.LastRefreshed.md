# SharedWorkspace.LastRefreshed property (Office)

Gets the date and time when the  **Refresh** method was most recently called. Read-only.

> [!NOTE] 
> Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Syntax

_expression_. `LastRefreshed`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [SharedWorkspace](Office.SharedWorkspace.md) object.


## Remarks

The  **LastRefreshed** property raises an error if the **[Refresh](Office.SharedWorkspace.Refresh.md)** method has never been called.


## Example

The following example refreshes the shared workspace if it has not been refreshed in the last 3 minutes. The example also handles the error condition where the workspace has not yet been refreshed.


```vb
    On Error GoTo err_NeverRefreshed 
    If DateDiff("s", ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.LastRefreshed, Now) > 180 Then 
        ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Refresh 
    End If 
    Exit Sub 
     
err_NeverRefreshed: 
          ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Refresh 

```
