## Remarks

If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own **Event** objects, use the **[Add](visio.eventlist.add.md)** or **[AddAdvise](visio.eventlist.addadvise.md)** method. 

To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. 

To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. 

To find an event code for the event that you want to create, see [Event codes](../visio/Concepts/event-codesvisio.md).
