# ShapeRange.Distribute method (Project)
The **Distribute** method is not implemented in Project.

## Syntax

_expression_. `Distribute` _(DistributeCmd,_ _RelativeTo)_

_expression_ A variable that represents a 'ShapeRange' object.


## Return value

 **Nothing**


## Remarks

In general for applications that implement Office Art,, the **Distribute** method evenly distributes the shapes contained in the shape range. Project does not support automatic distribution or alignment of shapes in a report.

If you try to use the **Distribute** method, such as `sRange1.Distribute msoDistributeHorizontally, msoFalse`, you get run-time error &H80070057, "The specified value is out of range."
