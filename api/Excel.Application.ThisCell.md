# Application.ThisCell property (Excel)

Returns the cell in which the user-defined function is being called from as a  **[Range](Excel.Range(object).md)** object.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ThisCell`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application-graph-property.md) object.


## Remarks

Users should not access properties or methods on the  **Range** object when inside the user-defined function. Users can cache the **Range** object for later use and perform additional actions when the recalculation is finished.


## Example

In this example, a function called "UseThisCell" contains the  **ThisCell** property to notify the user of the cell address.


```vb
Function UseThisCell() 
 MsgBox "The cell address is: " & _ 
 Application.ThisCell.Address 
End Function
```
