# SelectNamesDialog.AllowMultipleSelection property (Outlook)

Returns or sets a **Boolean** that determines whether more than one address entry can be selected at a time in the **Select Names** dialog. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AllowMultipleSelection`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [SelectNamesDialog](Outlook.SelectNamesDialog.md) object.


## Remarks

The default value of  **AllowMultipleSelection** is **True**. If  **AllowMultipleSelection** is set to **True**, the user can select multiple recipients by using the  **CTRL** or **SHIFT** key. If **AllowMultipleSelection** is set to **False**, multiple selection is disabled. 

Setting  **AllowMultipleSelection** to **False** does not ensure that only one recipient can be selected. The user can type additional recipients in the edit box or select from the recipient list multiple times. To ensure that only one recipient can be selected in the dialog, set **AllowMultipleSelect** to **False** and **[SelectNamesDialog.NumberOfRecipientSelectors](Outlook.SelectNamesDialog.NumberOfRecipientSelectors.md)** to **olShowNone**.
