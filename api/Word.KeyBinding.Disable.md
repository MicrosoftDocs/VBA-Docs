# KeyBinding.Disable method (Word)

Removes the specified key combination if it is currently assigned to a command. After you use this method, the key combination has no effect.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Disable`

_expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[KeyBinding](Word.KeyBinding.md)' object.


## Remarks

Using this method is the equivalent to clicking the **Remove** button in the **Customize Keyboard** dialog box. Use the **Clear** method with a **KeyBinding** object to reset a built-in command to its default key assignment. You don't need to remove or rebind a **KeyBinding** object before adding it elsewhere.


## Example

This example removes the CTRL+SHIFT+B key assignment. This key combination is assigned to the Bold command by default.


```vb
CustomizationContext = NormalTemplate 
FindKey(BuildKeyCode(wdKeyControl, wdKeyShift, wdKeyB)).Disable
```

This example assigns the CTRL+SHIFT+O key combination to the **Organizer** command. The example then uses the Disable method to remove the CTRL+SHIFT+O key combination and displays a message.




```vb
CustomizationContext = NormalTemplate 
KeyBindings.Add KeyCode:=BuildKeyCode(wdKeyO, _ 
 wdKeyControl, wdKeyShift), _ 
 KeyCategory:=wdKeyCategoryCommand, Command:="Organizer" 
With FindKey(BuildKeyCode(wdKeyO, wdKeyControl, wdKeyShift)) 
 MsgBox .Command & " is assigned to CTRL+Shift+O" 
 .Disable 
 If .Command = "" Then MsgBox _ 
 "Nothing is assigned to CTRL+Shift+O" 
End With
```

This example removes all key assignments for the global macro named "Macro1."




```vb
Dim kbLoop As KeyBinding 
 
CustomizationContext = NormalTemplate 
For Each kbLoop In KeysBoundTo _ 
 (KeyCategory:=wdKeyCategoryMacro, Command:="Macro1") 
 kbLoop.Disable 
Next kbLoop
```
