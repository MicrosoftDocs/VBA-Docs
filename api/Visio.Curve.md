# Curve object (Visio)

An item in a **[Path](visio.path.md)** object that represents a consecutive sequence of rows in the Geometry section of its **Path** object.


## Remarks

The default property of a **Curve** object is **Point**.

If a **Curve** object is in a collection returned by the **[Paths](visio.shape.paths.md)** property of a **Shape** object, its coordinates are expressed in the shape's parent coordinate system. 

If the **Curve** object is in a collection returned by the **[PathsLocal](visio.shape.pathslocal.md)** property of a **Shape** object, its coordinates are expressed in the shape's local coordinate system. In both cases, the coordinates are expressed in internal drawing units (inches).

A **Curve** object describes itself in terms of its parameter domain, which is the range `[Start(),End()]`. 

Use the **Start** property to obtain the curve's starting point and the **End** property to obtain the curve's ending point.

Use the **Point** method to extrapolate a point along the curve's path. 

Use the **PointAndDerivatives** method to determine a point along the curve's path and, optionally, its first and second derivatives.

Use the **Points** method to obtain a stream of points that approximate the curve's path.
