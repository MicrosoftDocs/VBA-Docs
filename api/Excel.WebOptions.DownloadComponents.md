# WebOptions.DownloadComponents property (Excel)

 **True** if the necessary Microsoft Office Web components are downloaded when you view the saved document in a Web browser, but only if the components are not already installed. **False** if the components are not downloaded. The default value is **False**. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `DownloadComponents`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [WebOptions](./Excel.WebOptions.md) object.


## Remarks

You can set the  **[LocationOfComponents](Excel.WebOptions.LocationOfComponents.md)** property to a central URL (on the intranet or Web) or path (local or network) to a location from which authorized users can download components when viewing your saved document. The path must be valid and must point to a location that contains the necessary components, and the user must have a valid Microsoft Office license.

Office Web components add interactivity to documents that you save as Web pages. If you view a Web page in a browser on a computer that does not have the components installed, the interactive portions of the page will be static.


## Example

This example allows the Office Web components to be downloaded with the specified Web page, if they are not already installed.


```vb
Application.DefaultWebOptions.DownloadComponents = True 
Application.DefaultWebOptions.LocationOfComponents = _ 
 Application.Path & Application.PathSeparator & "foo"
```
