# Application.SupportsMultipleWindows property (Project)

Always  **True** for Project and any other application that can have more than one window open at a time. Read-only **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `SupportsMultipleWindows`

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Application](Project.Application.md)** object.


## Remarks

The **SupportsMultipleWindows** property is useful with Automation. For example, suppose you want to open a second window in the application referred to by a variable. If the variable refers to one of several possible applications, you may want to use the **SupportsMultipleWindows** property to confirm that the application currently referenced by the variable can have more than one window open at a time.
