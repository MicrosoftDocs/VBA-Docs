# CoAuthor object (Word)

Represents a single co author in the document. The **CoAuthor** object is a member of the **[CoAuthors](Word.CoAuthors.md)** collection. The **CoAuthors** collection contains all the co authors in the document (authors that are actively editing the document).


> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Documents can only be co authored on a server that supports the File Synchronization via SOAP over HTTP protocol, such as Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010.


## Remarks

Use  **CoAuthors** (_index_), where _index_ is the index number to return a single **CoAuthor** object.


> [!NOTE] 
> When a new co author begins to edit the document, it can take up to one minute or longer for the co author to appear in the document.


## Example

The following code example returns the name of the first co author in the active document.


```vb
Dim author As CoAuthor 
 
Set author = ActiveDocument.CoAuthoring.Authors(1) 
MsgBox "The name of the first co author in this document is " & author.Name
```
