# Explorer.BeforeFolderSwitch event (Outlook)

Occurs before the explorer goes to a new folder, either as a result of user action or through program code.


## Syntax

_expression_. `BeforeFolderSwitch`( `_NewFolder_` , `_Cancel_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Explorer](Outlook.Explorer.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _NewFolder_|Required| **Object**|The **[Folder](Outlook.Folder.md)** object the explorer is switching to.|
| _Cancel_|Required| **Boolean**| **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, navigation is cancelled, and the current folder is not changed.|

## Remarks

This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).

If the folder being switched to is in a namespace that doesn't support automation (such as the file system),  _NewFolder_ is **Nothing**.


## Example

This sample prevents a user from switching to a folder named "Off Limits". The sample code must be placed in a class module such as  `ThisOutlookSession`, and the  `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook. To run this example without errors, make sure a folder by the name 'Off Limits' exists in the folder displayed in the active explorer.


```vb
Public WithEvents myOlExp As Outlook.Explorer 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myOlExp = Application.ActiveExplorer 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlExp_BeforeFolderSwitch(ByVal NewFolder As Object, Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 If NewFolder.Name = "Off Limits" Then 
 
 MsgBox "You do not have permission to access this folder." 
 
 Cancel = True 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
