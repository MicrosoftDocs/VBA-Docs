# FileDialog.InitialView Property (Office)

## Syntax

 _expression_. `InitialView`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [FileDialog](./Office.FileDialog.md) object.


## Example

The following example displays a  **File Picker** dialog box in details view using the **FileDialog** object and displays each selected file in a message box.


```vb
Sub Main() 
 
 'Declare a variable as a FileDialog object. 
 Dim fd As FileDialog

 Set fd = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFilePicker) 
 
 'Declare a variable to contain the path 
 'of each selected item. Even though the path is aString, 
 'the variable must be a Variant because For Each...Next 
 'routines only work with Variants and Objects. 
 Dim vrtSelectedItem As Variant 
 
 'Use a With...End With block to reference the FileDialog object. 
 With fd 
 
 'Set the initial view to the details view. 
 .InitialView = msoFileDialogViewDetails 
 
 'Use the Show method to display the File Picker dialog box and return the user's action. 
 'If the user presses the button... 
 If .Show = -1 Then 
 
 'Step through each string in the FileDialogSelectedItems collection. 
 For Each vrtSelectedItem In .SelectedItems 
 
 'vrtSelectedItem is aString that contains the path of each selected item. 
 'You can use any file I/O functions that you want to work with this path. 
 'This example displays the path in a message box. 
 MsgBox "Selected item's path: " &amp; vrtSelectedItem 
 
 Next vrtSelectedItem 
 'If the user presses Cancel... 
 Else 
 End If 
 End With 
 
 'Set the object variable to Nothing.
