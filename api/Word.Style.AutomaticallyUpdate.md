# Style.AutomaticallyUpdate property (Word)

 **True** if the style is automatically redefined based on the selection. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AutomaticallyUpdate`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[Style](Word.Style.md)' object.


## Remarks

If the **AutomaticallyUpdate** property is set to **False**, Microsoft Word prompts for confirmation before redefining the style based on the selection. A style can be redefined when it is applied to a selection that has the same style but different manual formatting. The AutomaticallyUpdate property applies to paragraph styles only.


## Example

This example creates a style named "Style1" that can be redefined without the need for confirmation.


```vb
Dim docNew as Document 
Dim styleNew as Style 
 
Set docNew = Documents.Add 
Set styleNew = docNew.Styles.Add("Style1") 
 
With styleNew 
 .BaseStyle = docNew.Styles(wdStyleNormal) 
 .ParagraphFormat.LineSpacingRule = wdLineSpaceDouble 
 .AutomaticallyUpdate = True 
End With
```
