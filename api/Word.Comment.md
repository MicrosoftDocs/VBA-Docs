# Comment object (Word)

Represents a single comment. The **Comment** object is a member of the **[Comments](Word.comments.md)** collection. The **Comments** collection includes comments in a selection, range or document.


## Remarks

Use  **Comments** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **Comment** object. The index number represents the position of the comment in the specified selection, range, or document. The following example displays the author of the first comment in the active document.


```vb
MsgBox ActiveDocument.Comments(1).Author
```

Use the **[Add](Word.Comments.Add.md)** method to add a comment at the specified range. The following example adds a comment immediately after the selection.




```vb
Selection.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd 
ActiveDocument.Comments.Add Range:=Selection.Range, _ 
 Text:="review this"
```

Use the **[Reference](Word.Comment.Reference.md)** property to return the reference mark associated with the specified comment. Use the **[Range](Word.Comment.Range.md)** property to return the text associated with the specified comment. The following example displays the text associated with the first comment in the active document.




```vb
MsgBox ActiveDocument.Comments(1).Range.Text
```
