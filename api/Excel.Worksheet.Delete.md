# Worksheet.Delete Method (Excel)

Deletes the object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Delete`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Worksheet](./Excel.Worksheet.md) object.


### Return Value

Boolean


## Remarks

When you delete a **[Worksheet](Excel.Worksheet.md)**, this method displays a dialog box that prompts the user to confirm the deletion. This dialog box is displayed by default. When called on the **Worksheet** object, the **Delete** method returns a **Boolean** value that is **False** if the user clicked **Cancel** on the dialog box or **True** if the user clicked **Delete**.

To delete a worksheet without displaying a dialog box, set the **[Application.DisplayAlerts](application-displayalerts-property-excel.md)** property to **False**.
