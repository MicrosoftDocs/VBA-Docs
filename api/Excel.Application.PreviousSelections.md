# Application.PreviousSelections Property (Excel)

Returns an array of the last four ranges or names selected. Each element in the array is a  **[Range](Excel.Range(object).md)** object. Read-only **Variant** .


## Syntax

 _expression_. `PreviousSelections`( `_Index_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application(Graph property).md) object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Index_|Optional| **Variant**|The index number (from 1 to 4) of the previous range or name.|

## Remarks

Each time you go to a range or cell by using the  **Name** box or the **Go To** command (**Edit** menu), or each time a macro calls the **[Goto](Excel.Application.Goto.md)** method, the previous range is added to this array as element number 1, and the other items in the array are moved down.


## Example

This example displays the cell addresses of all items in the array of previous selections. If there are no previous selections, the  **LBound** function returns an error. This error is trapped, and a message box appears.


```vb
On Error GoTo noSelections 
For i = LBound(Application.PreviousSelections) To _ 
 UBound(Application.PreviousSelections) 
 MsgBox Application.PreviousSelections(i).Address 
Next i 
Exit Sub 
On Error GoTo 0 
 
noSelections: 
 MsgBox "There are no previous selections"
```
