# AddressEntries object (Outlook)

Contains a collection of addresses for an **[AddressList](Outlook.AddressList.md)** object.


## Remarks

The object may contain zero or more  **[AddressEntry](Outlook.AddressEntry.md)** objects and provides access to the entries in a transport provider's address book container.


## Example

The following example sets a reference to an **AddressEntries** object.






```vb
Set myNameSpace = Application.GetNameSpace("MAPI") 
 
Set myAddressList = myNameSpace.AddressLists("Personal Address Book") 
 
Set myAddressEntries = myAddressList.AddressEntries
```

You can also index directly into the  **AddressEntries** object, returning an **AddressEntry** object.




```vb
Set myAddressEntry = myAddressList.AddressEntries(index)
```
