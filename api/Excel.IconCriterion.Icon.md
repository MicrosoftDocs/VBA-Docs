# IconCriterion.Icon property (Excel)

Returns or specifies the icon for a criterion in an icon set conditional formatting rule. Read/write


## Syntax

_expression_. `Icon`

_expression_ A variable that represents an '[IconCriterion](Excel.IconCriterion.md)' object.


## Remarks

After you set the  **Icon** property for the icon criterion in an icon set conditional formatting rule, the **[IconSet](Excel.IconSetCondition.IconSet.md)** property is changed to **xlCustomSet**.


## Example

The following code example creates an icon set conditional formatting rule that displays four icons split across the specified percentages. The icon set is initially set to use the  **4 Arrows (Colored)** icon set, but the **Icon** property is used to override which icons are used for the first and third criteria. After running the code, the icon for the first criterion is the **Red Cross** icon, the icon for the second criterion is the second arrow from the **4 Arrows (Colored)** icon set, the icon for the third criterion is the **Yellow Traffic Light** icon, and the icon for the fourth criterion is the fourth arrow from **4 Arrows (Colored)** icon set.


```vb
Range("A1:A10").Select 
Selection.FormatConditions.AddIconSetCondition 
Selection.FormatConditions(Selection.FormatConditions.Count).SetFirstPriority 
 
With Selection.FormatConditions(1) 
 .ReverseOrder = False 
 .ShowIconOnly = False 
 .IconSet = ActiveWorkbook.IconSets(xl4Arrows) 
End With 
 
With Selection.FormatConditions(1).IconCriteria(1) 
 .Icon = xlIconRedCross 
End With 
 
With Selection.FormatConditions(1).IconCriteria(2) 
 .Type = xlConditionValuePercent 
 .Value = 25 
 .Operator = 7 
End With 
 
With Selection.FormatConditions(1).IconCriteria(3) 
 .Type = xlConditionValuePercent 
 .Value = 50 
 .Operator = 7 
 .Icon = xlIconYellowTrafficLight 
End With 
 
With Selection.FormatConditions(1).IconCriteria(4) 
 .Type = xlConditionValuePercent 
 .Value = 75 
 .Operator = 7 
End With
```
