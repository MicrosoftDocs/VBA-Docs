# Selection.AddToContainers method (Visio)

Adds the selection of shapes to all underlying containers that allow it as a member.


## Syntax

_expression_. `AddToContainers`

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Selection](Visio.Selection.md)** object.


## Return value

 **Nothing**


## Remarks

When you call the  **AddToContainers** method, Microsoft Visio uses the setting of the **[ContainerProperties.ResizeAsNeeded](Visio.ContainerProperties.ResizeAsNeeded.md)** property for each container to determine how the container resizes.

Each shape in the selection is added to its underlying containers according to the position of the shape. As a result, different shapes may end up being contained by different containers. If the underlying container is a list, the shape is added as normal container member, not list member.

The  **AddToContainers** method works only if the selection sits at least partially on top of a container that does not already contain it.
