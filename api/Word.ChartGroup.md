# ChartGroup object (Word)

Represents one or more series plotted in a chart with the same format.


## Remarks

A chart contains one or more chart groups, each chart group contains one or more **[Series](Word.Series.md)** objects, and each series contains one or more **[Points](Word.Points.md)** objects. For example, a single chart might contain both a line chart group, which contains all the series plotted with the line chart format, and a bar chart group, which contains all the series plotted with the bar chart format. The **ChartGroup** object is a member of the **[ChartGroups](Word.ChartGroups.md)** collection.

Use  **ChartGroups** ( _Index_ ), where _index_ is the chart group index number, to return a single **ChartGroup** object.


## Example

The following example adds drop lines to the first chart group of the first chart in the active document.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Chart 
 .ChartGroups(1).HasDropLines = True 
End With
```
