# ProtectedViewWindow.Workbook property (Excel)

Returns an object that represents the workbook that is open in the specified  **Protected View** window. Read-only


## Syntax

_expression_. `Workbook`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[ProtectedViewWindow](Excel.ProtectedViewWindow.md)' object.


## Return value

 **[Workbook](Excel.Workbook.md)**


## Remarks

Because a  **Protected View** window is designed to protect the user from potentially malicious code, the operations you can perform by using a **Workbook** object returned by the **Workbook** method will be limited. Any operation that is not allowed will return an error.

A workbook displayed in a protected view window is not a member of the  **[Workbooks](Excel.Workbooks.md)** collection. Instead, use the **Workbook** property of the **ProtectedViewWindow** object to access a workbook that is displayed in a protected view window.


## Example

 The following example uses the **Workbook** property to return the workbook that is open in the first **Protected View** window.


```vb
Dim wbProtected As Workbook 
 
If Application.ProtectedViewWindows.Count > 0 Then 
    Set wbProtected = Application.ProtectedViewWindows(1).Workbook 
End If 

```
