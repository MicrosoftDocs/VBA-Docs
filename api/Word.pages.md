# Pages object (Word)

A collection of pages in a document. Use the **Pages** collection and the related objects and properties for programmatically defining page layout in a document.


## Remarks

Use the **Pages** property to return a **Pages** collection. The following example accesses all pages in the active document.


```vb
Dim objPages As Pages 
 
Set objPage = ActiveDocument. _ 
 ActiveWindow.Panes(1).Pages
```

Use the **Item** method to access an individual **Page** object that represents an individual page in a document. The following example accesses the first page in the active document.




```vb
Dim objPage As Page 
 
Set objPage = ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow _ 
 .Panes(1).Pages.Item(1)
```
