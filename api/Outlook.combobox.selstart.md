# ComboBox.SelStart Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a **Long** that represents the starting point of selected text, or the insertion point if no text is selected. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**SelStart**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

For  **[SelLength](Outlook.combobox.sellength.md)** and **SelStart**, the valid range of settings is 0 to the total number of characters in the edit area of a **[ComboBox](Outlook.combobox.md)**. The default value is zero.

The **SelStart** property is always valid, even when the control does not have focus. Setting **SelStart** to a value less than zero creates an error. Attempting to set **SelStart** to a value greater than the number of characters available in a control results in a value equal to the number of characters in the control.

Changing the value of  **SelStart** cancels any existing selection in the control, places an insertion point in the text, and sets the **SelLength** property to zero.
