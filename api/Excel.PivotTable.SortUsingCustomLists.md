# PivotTable.SortUsingCustomLists Property (Excel)

The  **SortUsingCustomLists** property controls whether custom lists are used for sorting items of fields, both initially when the PivotField is initialized and the PivotItems are ordered by their captions; and later when the user applies a sort. Read/write **Boolean** .


## Syntax

 _expression_. `SortUsingCustomLists`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [PivotTable](Excel.PivotTable.md) object.


## Remarks

Setting this property to  **False** can optimize performance for fields with many items, and it also allows users who do not want custom list-based sorting to avoid it.
