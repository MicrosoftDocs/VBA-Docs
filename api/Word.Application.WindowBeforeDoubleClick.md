# Application.WindowBeforeDoubleClick Event (Word)

Occurs when the editing area of a document window is double-clicked, before the default double-click action.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Private Sub object_WindowBeforeDoubleClick`( `_ByVal Sel As Selection_` , `_Cancel As Boolean_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents an '[Application](Word.Application.md)' object that has been declared with events in a class module. For more information about using events with the **Application** object, see [Using Events with the Application Object](../word/Concepts/Objects-Properties-Methods/using-events-with-the-application-object-word.md).


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Sel_|Required| **Selection**|The current selection.|
| _Cancel_|Required| **Boolean**| **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True** , the default double-click action does not occur when the procedure is finished.|

## Example

This example prompts the user for a yes or no response before executing the default double-click action. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see [Using Events with the Application Object](../word/Concepts/Objects-Properties-Methods/using-events-with-the-application-object-word.md)for directions on how to accomplish this.


```vb
Public WithEvents appWord as Word.Application 
 
Private Sub appWord_WindowBeforeDoubleClick _ 
 (ByVal Sel As Selection, Cancel As Boolean) 
 Dim intResponse As Integer 
 intResponse = MsgBox("Selection = " & Sel & vbLf & vbLf _ 
 & "Continue with operation on this selection?", _ 
 vbYesNo) 
 If intResponse = vbNo Then Cancel = True 
End Sub
```
