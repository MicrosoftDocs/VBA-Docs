# Font Object (Visio)

Represents a typeface that is either applied to text in a document or available for use on the system.


## Remarks

The default property of a  **Font** object is **Name**.

A  **Font** object maps its name (for example, "Arial") to the font ID (for example, 3) that Microsoft Visio stores in a Font cell in a Character section of a shape whose text is formatted with that font. Font IDs can change when a document is opened on different systems or when fonts are installed or removed.
