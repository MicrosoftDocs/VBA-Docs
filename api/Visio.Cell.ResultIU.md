# Cell.ResultIU Property (Visio)

Gets or sets a cell's value in internal units. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ResultIU`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Cell](./Visio.Cell.md) object.


## Return value

Double


## Remarks

Use the  **ResultIU** property to set the value of an unguarded cell. If a cell's formula is protected with a GUARD function, the formula is not changed and an error is generated. To set the value of a guarded cell in internal units, use the **ResultIUForce** property.

The units default to the Microsoft Visio internal units, which are inches for distance and radians for angles.
