# Chart.ShowAllFieldButtons Property (PowerPoint)

Returns or sets a value that indicates whether to display all field buttons on a PivotChart. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ShowAllFieldButtons`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Chart](./PowerPoint.Chart.md) object.

 **Boolean**


## Remarks

This member is part of the shared chart object model infrastructure between Word, Excel, and PowerPoint and is not meant to be called directly from your code. Reading or setting this property causes a run-time error. In PowerPoint, you cannot create a PivotChart, and copying or pasting a valid PivotChart from Excel to a PowerPoint presentation will convert the PivotChart to a Chart.
