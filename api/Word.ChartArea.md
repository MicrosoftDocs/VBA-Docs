# ChartArea object (Word)

Represents the chart area of a chart. 


## Remarks

The chart area includes everything, including the plot area. However, the **[PlotArea](Word.PlotArea.md)** object has its own formatting, so formatting the plot area does not format the chart area.

Use the **[ChartArea](Word.Chart.ChartArea.md)** property to return the **ChartArea** object.


## Example

The following example turns off the border for the chart area in the first chart of the active document.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Chart 
 ChartArea.Format.Line.Visible = False 
End With
```
