# ModelChanges object (Excel)

Represents changes made to the data model. 


## Remarks

The  **ModelChanges** object contains information about which changes were made to the data model when the Workbook.[Workbook.ModelChange Event (Excel)](Excel.workbook.modelchange.md) (Excel) event occurs after a model operation. When Excel makes changes to the data model, multiple changes can be made in the same operation and the **ModelChanges** object will include information about all the changes made in one model operation.
