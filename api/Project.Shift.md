# Shift object (Project)


 

Represents a work shift for a day, month, period, weekday, or year. There is no collection for  **Shift** objects. The **Shift** object can be accessed through the **Shift*n*** properties of appropriate objects, such as the **Day**. **[Shift1](Project.Day.Shift1.md)** property.
 
 **Using the Shift Object**
 
Use the  **Shift*n*** property to return a **Shift** object. The following example sets every Friday as a half-day by setting the start and finish times for the first shift and clearing the values of the second and third shifts.
