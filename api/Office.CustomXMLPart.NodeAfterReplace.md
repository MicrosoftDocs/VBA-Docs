# CustomXMLPart.NodeAfterReplace Event (Office)

Occurs just after a node is replaced in a  **CustomXMLPart** object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `NodeAfterReplace`( `_OldNode_`, `_NewNode_`, `_InUndoRedo_` )

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [CustomXMLPart](./Office.CustomXMLPart.md) object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _OldNode_|Required|**CustomXMLNode**|Corresponds to the node which was just removed from the  **CustomXMLPart** object. Note that this node may have children, if a subtree was just added to the document. Also, this node will be a "disconnected" node in that you can query down from the node, but cannot go up - it appears to exist alone.|
| _NewNode_|Required|**CustomXMLNode**|Corresponds to the node just added to the  **CustomXMLPart** object.|
| _InUndoRedo_|Required|**Boolean**|Returns  **TRUE** if the node was added as part of an Undo/Redo action by the user.|

## Example

The following example displays a message telling the user the results of replacing the node.


```vb
Sub CustomXMLParts_NodeAfterReplace(oldNode As CustomXMLNode, newNode As CustomXMLNode, boolInUndoRedo As Boolean) 
   MsgBox ("The part's node " &amp; oldNode.BaseName &amp; " was replaced with the node " &amp; newNode.BaseName) 
End Sub
```
