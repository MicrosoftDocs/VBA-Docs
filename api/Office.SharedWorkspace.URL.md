> [!NOTE] 
> Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `URL`

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [SharedWorkspace](./Office.SharedWorkspace.md) object.


### Return value

String


## Remarks

The URL property returns the address of the shared workspace in this format:  `https://server/sites/user/workspace/`. The URL property returns a URL-encoded string. For example, a space in the folder name is represented by %20. Use a simple function like the following example to replace this escaped character with a space. `Private Function URLDecode(URLtoDecode As String) As String URLDecode = Replace(URLtoDecode, "%20", " ") End Function`


## Example

The following example displays the base URL of the shared workspace.


```vb
 MsgBox "URL: " &amp; ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspaceLink.URL, _ 
        vbInformation + vbOKOnly, "Shared Workspace URL" 

```
