# Sequence object (PowerPoint)

Represents a collection of  **[Effect](PowerPoint.Effect.md)** objects for a slide's interactive animation sequences. The **Sequence** collection is a member of the **[Sequences](PowerPoint.Sequences.md)** collection.


## Example

Use the [MainSequence](PowerPoint.TimeLine.MainSequence.md)property of the  **[TimeLine](PowerPoint.TimeLine.md)** object to return a **Sequence** object.

Use the [AddEffect](PowerPoint.Sequence.AddEffect.md)method to add a new **Sequence** object. This example adds a shape and an animation sequence to the first shape on the first slide in the active presentation.




```vb
Sub NewEffect()

    Dim effNew As Effect
    Dim shpFirst As Shape

    Set shpFirst = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1)

    Set effNew = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine.MainSequence.AddEffect _
        (Shape:=shpFirst, effectId:=msoAnimEffectBlinds)

End Sub
```
