# Explorer.BeforeMinimize Event (Outlook)

Occurs when the active explorer is minimized by the user.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `BeforeMinimize`( `_Cancel_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [Explorer](./Outlook.Explorer.md) object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Cancel_|Required| **Boolean**| **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True** , the operation is not completed and the explorer is not minimized.|

## Remarks

This event can be cancelled after it has started.


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example prompts the user with a message before the window is minimized. If the user clicks  **Yes**, the explorer is minimized. The sample code must be placed in a class module such as  `ThisOutlookSession`, and the  `Initialize_Handler()` subroutine should be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```vb
Public WithEvents myOlExp As Outlook.Explorer 
 
 
 
Sub Initalize_Handler() 
 
 Set myOlExp = Application.ActiveExplorer 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlExp_BeforeMinimize(Cancel As Boolean) 
 
'Prompts the user before minimizing the Explorer 
 
 
 
 Dim lngAns As Long 
 
 
 
 lngAns = MsgBox("Are you sure you want to minimize the current window?", vbYesNo) 
 
 If lngAns = vbYes Then 
 
 Cancel = False 
 
 Else 
 
 Cancel = True 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
