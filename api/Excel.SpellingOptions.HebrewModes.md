## Syntax

_expression_. `HebrewModes`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [SpellingOptions](./Excel.SpellingOptions.md) object.


## Remarks



| **xlHebrewModes** can be one of these **xlHebrewModes** constants.|
| **xlHebrewFullScript** (default) The conventional script type as required by the Hebrew Language Academy when writing non-diacritisized text.|
| **xlHebrewMixedAuthorizedScript** The Hebrew traditional script.|
| **xlHebrewMixedScript** In this mode the speller accepts any word recognized as Hebrew, whether in Full Script, Partial Script, or any non-conventional spelling variation what is known to the speller.|

```vb
Sub CheckHebrewMode() 
 
 ' Determine the Hebrew spelling mode setting and notify user. 
 Select Case Application.SpellingOptions.HebrewModes 
 Case xlHebrewFullScript 
 MsgBox "The Hebrew spelling mode setting is Full Script." 
 Case xlHebrewMixedAuthorizedScript 
 MsgBox "The Hebrew spelling mode setting is Mixed Authorized Script." 
 Case xlHebrewMixedScript
