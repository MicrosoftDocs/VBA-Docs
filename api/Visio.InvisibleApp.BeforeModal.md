# InvisibleApp.BeforeModal Event (Visio)

Occurs before a Microsoft Visio instance enters a modal state.


## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression_ _'BeforeModal'(**_ByVal app As [IVAPPLICATION]_**)

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [InvisibleApp](./Visio.InvisibleApp.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _app_|Required| **[IVAPPLICATION]**|The instance of Visio that is going to enter a modal state.|

## Remarks

Visio becomes modal when it displays a dialog box. A modal instance of Visio does not handle Automation calls. The  **BeforeModal** event indicates that an instance is about to become modal, and the **AfterModal** event indicates that the instance is no longer modal.

If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the syntax in this topic describes a common, efficient way to handle events.

If you want to create your own  **Event** objects, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method. To create an **Event** object that runs an add-on, use the **Add** method as it applies to the **EventList** collection. To create an **Event** object that receives notification, use the **AddAdvise** method. To find an event code for the event you want to create, see [Event codes](../visio/Concepts/event-codesvisio.md).
