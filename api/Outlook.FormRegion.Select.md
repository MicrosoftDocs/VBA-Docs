# FormRegion.Select Method (Outlook)

Makes the form region the active form region such that it becomes visible.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Select`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [FormRegion](./Outlook.FormRegion.md) object.


## Remarks

If the form region is an adjoining form region, then  **Select** will expand the form region (if it is not already expanded) and set focus on the first control on that page. If the form region is a separate form region and is not already the active page, then **Select** will swtich to the form region page and set focus on the first control on that page. If the form region is a separate form region and is already the active page, then nothing happens.
