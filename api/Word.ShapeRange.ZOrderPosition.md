# ShapeRange.ZOrderPosition property (Word)

Returns a  **Long** that represents the position of the specified shape in the z-order. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ZOrderPosition`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a 'ShapeRange' object.


## Remarks

 `Shapes(1)` returns the shape at the back of the z-order, and `Shapes(Shapes.Count)` returns the shape at the front of the z-order. This property is read-only. To set the shape's position in the z-order, use the **ZOrder** method.

A shape's position in the z-order corresponds to the shape's index number in the Shapes collection. For example, if there are four shapes on myDocument, the expression  `myDocument.Shapes(1)` returns the shape at the back of the z-order, and the expression `myDocument.Shapes(4)` returns the shape at the front of the z-order.

Whenever you add a new shape to a collection, it is added to the front of the z-order by default.
