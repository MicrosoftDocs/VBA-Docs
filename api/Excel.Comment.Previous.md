# Comment.Previous method (Excel)

Returns a  **[Comment](Excel.Comment.md)** object that represents the previous comment.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Previous`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [Comment](Excel.Comment.md) object.


## Return value

Comment


## Remarks

This method works only on one sheet. Using this method on the first comment on a sheet returns  **Null** (not the last comment on the previous sheet).


## Example

This example deletes every second comment, navigating with the  **Previous** method.


 **Note**  Please test in a new workbook with no existing comments. To clear all comments from a workbook use  `Selection.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeComments).Delete` in the **Immediate Pane**.


```vb
'Sets up the comments 
For xNum = 1 To 10 
 Range("A" & xNum).AddComment 
 Range("A" & xNum).Comment.Text Text:="Comment " & xNum 
Next 
 
MsgBox "Comments created... A1:A10" 
 
'Deletes every second comment in the A1:A10 range 
For yNum = 10 To 1 Step -2 
 Range("A" & yNum).Comment.Previous.Shape.Select True 
 Selection.Delete 
Next 
 
MsgBox "Deleted every second comment"
```
