# Shape.Characters property (Visio)

Returns a  **Characters** object that represents the text of a shape. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Characters`

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Shape](Visio.Shape.md)** object.


## Return value

Characters


## Remarks

If your Visual Studio solution includes the [Microsoft.Office.Interop.Visio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/vsto/office-primary-interop-assemblies?view=vs-2019) reference, this property maps to the following types:


-  **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Visio.IVShape.Characters**
    

## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **Characters** property of a shape to get a **Characters** object. Once a **Characters** object has been retrieved, the example uses the **Shape** property of the **Characters** object to get the shape that contains the characters and demonstrates that the containing shape has been retrieved by printing its text in the Immediate window.


```vb
 
Public Sub Characters_Example() 
  
    Dim vsoOval As Visio.Shape  
    Dim vsoShapeFromCharacters As Visio.Shape  
    Dim vsoCharacters As Visio.Characters  
 
    'Create a shape and add text to it. 
    Set vsoOval = ActivePage.DrawOval(2, 5, 5, 7)  
    vsoOval.Text = "Rectangular Shape"  
 
    'Get a Characters object from the oval shape. 
    Set vsoCharacters = vsoOval.Characters  
 
    'Set the Begin and End properties so that we can 
    'replace the word "Rectangular" with "Oval" 
    vsoCharacters.Begin = 0 
    vsoCharacters.End = 11 
    vsoCharacters.Text = "Oval" 
 
    'Use the Shape property of the Characters object 
    'to get the Shape object. 
    Set vsoShapeFromCharacters = vsoCharacters.Shape  
 
    'Print the shape's text to verify that the proper Shape 
    'object was returned.  
    Debug.Print vsoShapeFromCharacters.Text 
  
End Sub
```
