 **Important**  Dates should be entered by using the DATE function, or as results of other formulas or functions. For example, use DATE(2008,5,23) for the 23rd day of May, 2008. Problems can occur if dates are entered as text.



|**Basis**|**Day count basis**|
|:-----|:-----|

|1|Actual/actual|
|2|Actual/360|
|3|Actual/365|

- Microsoft Excel stores dates as sequential serial numbers so they can be used in calculations. By default, January 1, 1900 is serial number 1, and January 1, 2008 is serial number 39448 because it is 39,448 days after January 1, 1900. Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh uses a different date system as its default.
    
     **Note**  Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) calculates serial dates differently than Excel. In VBA, serial number 1 is December 31, 1899, rather than January 1, 1900. 
- The settlement date is the date a buyer purchases a coupon, such as a bond. The maturity date is the date when a coupon expires. For example, suppose a 30-year bond is issued on January 1, 2008, and is purchased by a buyer six months later. The issue date would be January 1, 2008, the settlement date would be July 1, 2008, and the maturity date would be January 1, 2038, which is 30 years after the January 1, 2008, issue date.
    
- Settlement, maturity, issue, and basis are truncated to integers.
    
- If settlement, maturity, or issue is not a valid date, YIELDMAT returns the #VALUE! error value.
    
- If rate < 0 or if pr ? 0, YIELDMAT returns the #NUM! error value.
    
- If basis < 0 or if basis > 4, YIELDMAT returns the #NUM! error value.
    
- If settlement ? maturity, YIELDMAT returns the #NUM! error value.
