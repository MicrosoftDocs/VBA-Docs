# Application.ShowCatalogUI Event (Publisher)

Fires when the catalog of publication wizards is displayed in the Microsoft Publisher user interface.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ShowCatalogUI**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Application** object.


## Remarks

You can use the  ** [Application.ShowWizardCatalog](Publisher.Application.ShowWizardCatalog.md)** method to display the wizard catalog in the user interface.

The  **ShowCatalogUI** event does not fire when the publication catalog is displayed when Publisher first starts. To determine if the catalog is displayed at that time, you can use the **[WizardCatalogVisible](Publisher.Application.WizardCatalogVisible.md)** property.

For more information about using events with the  **Application** object, see [Using Events with the Application Object](../publisher/Concepts/using-events-with-the-application-object-publisher.md).


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to handle the  **ShowCatalogUI** event. It displays a message notifying the user that the catalog UI was displayed.


```vb
Private Sub pubApplication_ShowCatalogUI() 
 MsgBox "The Wizard Catalog is displayed." 
End Sub
```

For this event to occur, you must place the following line of code in the  **General Declarations** section of your module.




```vb
Private WithEvents pubApplication As Application
```

Then run the following initialization procedure.




```vb
Public Sub Initialize_pubApplication() 
 Set pubApplication = Publisher.Application 
End Sub
```
