# OMathPhantom object (Word)

Represents a phantom object, which has two primary uses: (1) adding the spacing of the phantom base without displaying that base or (2) suppressing part of the glyph from spacing considerations.


## Remarks

Use the **OMathPhantom** object to display the spacing of part of an equation without displaying it, or to remove the spacing for part of a glyph from spacing considerations.
