| _Measures_|Optional| **Variant**|An array of unique names of measures that are to be part of the slice.|
| _Levels_|Optional| **Variant**|An array of strings. Each array item is a unique level name. It represents the lowest level of a hierarchy that is in the slice.|
| _Members_|Optional| **Variant**|An array of string arrays. The elements correspond, in order, to the hierarchies represented in the  _Levels_ array. Each element is an array of string arrays that consists of the unique names of the top level members in the dimension that are to be included in the slice.|

## Example

This example creates a cube file titled "CustomCubeFile" on drive C:\ with no member properties to be included in the slice. With the  _Measures_,  _Levels_, and  _Members_ arguments omitted from this example, the cube file will end up matching the view of the PivotTable report. This example assumes a PivotTable report connected to an OLAP data source exists on the active worksheet.


```vb
Sub UseCreateCubeFile() 
 
 ActiveSheet.PivotTables(1).CreateCubeFile _ 
 File:="C:\CustomCubeFile", Properties:=False 
 
End Sub
```
