# ToOrFromRuleCondition.ConditionType Property (Outlook)

Returns a constant from the  **[OlRuleConditionType](Outlook.OlRuleConditionType.md)** enumeration that indicates the type of rule condition. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `ConditionType`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [ToOrFromRuleCondition](./Outlook.ToOrFromRuleCondition.md) object.


## Remarks

 **ConditionType** depends on the type of rule condition, as two types of rule conditions use the **[ToOrFromRuleCondition](Outlook.ToOrFromRuleCondition.md)** object: **olConditionFrom** and **olConditionSentTo**. **olConditionFrom** is supported only by rules for receiving messages, while **olConditionSentTo** is supported by rules for receiving messages as well as rules for sending messages. For more information, see [Specify Rule Conditions](../outlook/How-to/Rules/specifying-rule-conditions.md).
