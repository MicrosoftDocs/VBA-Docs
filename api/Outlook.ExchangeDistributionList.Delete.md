# ExchangeDistributionList.Delete Method (Outlook)

Deletes the  **[ExchangeDistributionList](Outlook.ExchangeDistributionList.md)** object from the **[AddressEntries](Outlook.AddressEntries.md)** collection object to which it belongs.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Delete`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [ExchangeDistributionList](./Outlook.ExchangeDistributionList.md) object.


## Remarks

The  **ExchangeDistributionList** object is derived from the **[AddressEntry](Outlook.AddressEntry.md)** object. An **ExchangeDistributionList** object is an **AddressEntry** object that has **olExchangeDistributionListAddressEntry** as the **[AddressEntry.AddressEntryUserType](Outlook.AddressEntry.AddressEntryUserType.md)** ; calling **[AddressEntry.GetExchangeDistributionList](Outlook.AddressEntry.GetExchangeDistributionList.md)** returns the corresponding **ExchangeDistributionList** object.
