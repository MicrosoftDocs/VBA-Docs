# ProtectedViewWindow object (Excel)

Represents a  **Protected View** window.


## Remarks

A  **Protected View** window is used to display a workbook from a potentially unsafe location. Unsafe locations are defined as the following:


- Files opened from the Internet.
    
- Attachments opened from Outlook.
    
- Files blocked by File Block Policy.
    
- Files that fail Office File Validation.
    
- Files explicitly opened in  **Protected View** by using the **Open in Protected View** command of the **Open** button in the **Open** dialog box.
    


Workbooks displayed in a  **Protected View** window cannot be edited and are restricted from running active content such as Visual Basic for Applications macros and data connections. For more information about **Protected View** windows, see [What is Protected View?](https://support.office.com/article/what-is-protected-view-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653?ocmsassetID=HA010355931&CTT=1&CorrelationId=ad189265-115e-4f59-bdf0-ee99038a5bb0&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US)

 To return a single **ProtectedViewWindow** object from the **[ProtectedViewWindows](Excel.ProtectedViewWindows.md)** collection, use `ProtectedViewWindows(Index)`, where  _Index_ is the index number of the window you want to open. You can also access the **ProtectedViewWindow** object that represents the active **Protected View** window by using the **[ActiveProtectedViewWindow](Excel.Application.ActiveProtectedViewWindow.md)** property of the **[Application](Excel.Application(object).md)** object.

After you access a  **ProtectedViewWindow** object, use the **[Workbook](Excel.ProtectedViewWindow.Workbook.md)** property to access the **[Workbook](Excel.Workbook.md)** object that represents the workbook file that is open in the **Protected View** window. Because a **Protected View** window is designed to protect the user from potentially malicious code, the operations you can perform by using a **Workbook** object returned by a **ProtectedViewWindow** object will be limited. Operations that are not allowed will return an error.


## Example

 The following code example accesses the **Workbook** object that represents the workbook that is open in the first **Protected View** window.


```vb
Dim wbProtected As Workbook 
 
If Application.ProtectedViewWindows.Count > 0 Then 
    Set wbProtected = Application.ProtectedViewWindows(1).Workbook 
End If 

```
