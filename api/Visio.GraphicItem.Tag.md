# GraphicItem.Tag Property (Visio)

Gets or sets a user-defined string expression that can store extra data related to your program. Read/write.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Tag`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a [GraphicItem](./Visio.GraphicItem.md) object.


## Return value

String


## Remarks

Microsoft Visio makes no use of the  **Tag** property, nor does its value appear anywhere in the user interface. The **Tag** property is intended to be used by developers to store additional information about a graphic item or a data graphic.

For example, you can assign a  **Tag** property value to a particular graphic item as an identifier. Then, by writing a procedure that iterates through the **GraphicItems** collection and looks for a graphic item that has that specific **Tag** value, you can find the graphic item.


 **Note**  Before you can set any property of a graphic item, you must use the  **[Master.Open](Visio.Master.Open.md)** method to open a copy of the data graphic master that contains the graphic item for editing. When you are finished setting properties, use the **Master.Close** method to commit changes.
