    .Visible = True  
End With 
With CommandBars("Custom").Controls(1) 
    .AddItem "Get Stock Quote", 1 
    .AddItem "View Chart", 2 
    .AddItem "View Fundamentals", 3 
    .Caption = "Stock Data" 
    .DescriptionText = "View Data For Stock" 
End With 
If CommandBars("Custom").Controls(1).ListCount _ 
     > 4 Then
