# Application.UserControl Property (Excel)

 **True** if the application is visible or if it was created or started by the user. **False** if you created or started the application programmatically by using the **CreateObject** or **GetObject** functions, and the application is hidden. Read/write **Boolean** .


## Syntax

 _expression_. `UserControl`

 _expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application(Graph property).md) object.


## Remarks

When the  **UserControl** property is **False** for an object, that object is released when the last programmatic reference to the object is released. If this property is **False** , Microsoft Excel quits when the last object in the session is released.


## Example

This example displays the status of the  **UserControl** property.


```vb
If Application.UserControl Then 
 MsgBox "This workbook was created by the user" 
Else 
 MsgBox "This workbook was created programmatically" 
End If 

```
