# Font.Underline Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that specifies whether text is underlined. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Underline**

_expression_ A variable that represents a  **Font** object.


## Remarks

 **True** to indicate that the text is underlined, **False** otherwise.

The font's appearance on screen and in print may differ, depending on your computer and printer. If you select a font that your system can't display with the specified attribute or that isn't installed, Windows substitutes a similar font. The substitute font will be as similar as possible to the font originally requested.
