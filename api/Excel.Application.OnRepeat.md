# Application.OnRepeat method (Excel)

Sets the  **Repeat** item and the name of the procedure that will run if you choose the **Repeat** command after running the procedure that sets this property.


## Syntax

_expression_. `OnRepeat`( `_Text_` , `_Procedure_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents an [Application](Excel.Application-graph-property.md) object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Text_|Required| **String**|The text that appears with the  **Repeat** command.|
| _Procedure_|Required| **String**|The name of the procedure that will be run when you choose the  **Repeat** command.|

## Remarks

If a procedure doesn't use the  **OnRepeat** method, the **Repeat** command repeats procedure that was run most recently.

The procedure must use the  **OnRepeat** and **OnUndo** methods last, to prevent the repeat and undo procedures from being overwritten by subsequent actions in the procedure.


## Example

This example sets the repeat and undo procedures.


```vb
Application.OnRepeat "Repeat VB Procedure", _ 
 "Book1.xls!My_Repeat_Sub" 
Application.OnUndo "Undo VB Procedure", _ 
 "Book1.xls!My_Undo_Sub"
```
