| **wdLockEphemeral**|2|Specifies an ephemeral lock. Word implicitly places an ephemeral lock on a range when a user begins editing a range in a document with coauthoring enabled.|
| **wdLockNone**|0|Reserved for future use.|
| **wdLockReservation**|1|Specifies a reservation lock. A reservation lock is explicitly created by a user through the **Block Authors** button on the **Review** tab in Word.|
