## Remarks

The **[Application.GetCacheStatusForProject](Project.application.getcachestatusforproject.md)** property returns a **PjCacheJobState** constant. The **PjCacheJobState** constants from 0 to 13 correspond to the [JobState enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/websvcqueuesystem.jobstate_di_pj14mref%28office.15%29.aspx) of the **QueueSystem** service in the Project Server Interface (PSI).
