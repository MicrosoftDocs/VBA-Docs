## Remarks

Project events do not occur when the project is embedded in another document or application. For more information and sample code for creating and testing an event handler, see [Using Events with Application and Project Objects](../project/Concepts/using-events-with-application-and-project-objects.md) .

The  **ProjectBeforeAssignmentChange2** event doesn't occur when timescaled data changes, when an entire resource or task row is pasted, when an assignment is changed as the result of a drag-and-drop operation in the **Resource Usage** view, during resource pool operations, when inserting or removing a subproject, or when changes have been made using a custom form.
