```vb
Application.Wait "18:23:00"
```

This example pauses a running macro for approximately 10 seconds.




```vb
newHour = Hour(Now()) 
newMinute = Minute(Now()) 
newSecond = Second(Now()) + 10 
waitTime = TimeSerial(newHour, newMinute, newSecond) 
Application.Wait waitTime
```

This example displays a message indicating whether 10 seconds have passed.




```vb
If Application.Wait(Now + TimeValue("0:00:10")) Then 
 MsgBox "Time expired" 
End If
```
