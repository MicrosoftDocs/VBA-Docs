# Event Object (Visio)

A member of the  **EventList** collection of a source object such as a **Document**. An event encapsulates an event code.


## Remarks

An  **Event** object can trigger two kinds of actions: it can run an add-on, or it can send a notification of the event to the calling program. To create an **Event** object, use the **Add** or **AddAdvise** method of an **EventList** object.

The default property of an  **Event** object is **Event**.

The  **Event** property of the **Event** object establishes the event that triggers the action, and its **Action** property indicates the action to be performed.

Use the  **Persistable** property to find out if the event can be stored with a Microsoft Visio document, or the **Persistent** property to find out if the event is stored. Use the **Trigger** method to trigger an **Event** object's action without waiting for the event to occur. Use the **Enabled** property to temporarily disable an event.
