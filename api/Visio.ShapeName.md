# Viewer.ShapeName Property (Visio Viewer)

Gets the name of the shape at the specified index in the collection of shapes in the drawing that is open in Microsoft Visio Viewer. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ShapeName**(**_ShapeIndex_**)

 _expression_An expression that returns a  **Viewer** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|ShapeIndex|Required| **Long**|The index of the shape in the collection of shapes.|

## Return value

String


## Remarks

The collection of shapes is one-based, so the index of the first shape in the collection is 1. If there are no shapes in the drawing, or if you pass the index of a nonexistent shape, the  **ShapeName** property returns nothing.

The  **ShapeName** property returns the local name of the shape, not its universal name.


## Example

The following code gets the names of all the shapes in the drawing that is open in Visio Viewer.


```vb
Dim intCounter As Integer

    For intCounter = 1 To Viewer1.ShapeCount

    Debug.Print Viewer1.ShapeName(intCounter)

Next intCounter
```
