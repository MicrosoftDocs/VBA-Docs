# Document.Path property (Word)

Returns the disk or Web path to the document. Read-only  **String**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Path`

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[Document](Word.Document.md)' object.


## Remarks

The path doesn't include a trailing character â€” for example, "C:\MSOffice" or "https://MyServer". Use the  **PathSeparator** property to add the character that separates folders and drive letters. Use the **Name** property to return the file name without the path and use the **FullName** property to return the file name and the path together.


 **Note**  You can use the  **PathSeparator** property to build Web addresses even though they contain forward slashes (/) and the **PathSeparator** property defaults to a backslash (\).


## Example

This example displays the path and file name of the active document.


```vb
MsgBox ActiveDocument.Path & Application.PathSeparator & _ 
 ActiveDocument.Name
```

This example changes the current folder to the path of the template attached to the active document.




```vb
ChDir ActiveDocument.AttachedTemplate.Path
```
