# Rotation Property

Returns or sets the rotation of the 3-D chart view (the rotation of the plot area around the z-axis, in degrees). The value of this property must be from 0 to 360, except for 3-D bar charts, where the value must be from 0 to 44. The default value is 20. Applies only to 3-D charts. Read/write  **Variant**.


## Example

This example sets the rotation of  `myChart` to 30 degrees. The example should be run on a 3-D chart.


```vb
myChart.Rotation = 30
```
