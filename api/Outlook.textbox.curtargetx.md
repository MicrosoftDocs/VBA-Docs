# TextBox.CurTargetX Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns a **Long** that represents the preferred horizontal position of the insertion point in a multiline **[TextBox](Outlook.textbox.md)**. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_.**CurTargetX**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **TextBox** object.


## Remarks

The **CurTargetX** property retrieves the preferred position, measured in himetric units. A himetric is 0.0001 meter.

The target position is relative to the left edge of the control. If the length of a line is less than the value of the  **CurTargetX** property, you can place the insertion point at the end of the line. The value of **CurTargetX** changes when the user sets the insertion point or when the **[CurX](Outlook.textbox.curx.md)** property is set. **CurTargetX** is read-only.

The return value is valid when the object has focus.

You can use  **CurTargetX** and **CurX** to move the insertion point as the user scrolls through the contents of a multiline **TextBox**. When the user moves the insertion point to another line of text by scrolling the content of the object,  **CurTargetX** specifies the preferred position for the insertion point. **CurX** is set to this value if the line of text is longer than the value of **CurTargetX**. Otherwise,  **CurX** is set to the end of the line of text.
