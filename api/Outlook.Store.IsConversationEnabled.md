# Store.IsConversationEnabled Property (Outlook)

Returns a  **Boolean** value that is **True** if the store supports Conversation view. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `IsConversationEnabled`

_expression_ A variable that represents a '[Store](Outlook.Store.md)' object.


## Remarks

 A store supports Conversation view if the store is a POP, IMAP, or PST store, or if it runs a version of Microsoft Exchange Server that is at least Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. A store also supports Conversation view if the store is running Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, the version of Outlook is at least Outlook, and Outlook is running in cached mode.

If a store supports conversations, calling the  **GetConversation** method of an item in the store returns a **[Conversation](Outlook.Conversation.md)** object for the item. If the store does not support conversations, **GetConversation** returns **Null** (**Nothing** in Visual Basic) for items in the store.
