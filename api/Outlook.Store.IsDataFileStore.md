# Store.IsDataFileStore property (Outlook)

Returns a **Boolean** that indicates if the **[Store](Outlook.Store.md)** is a store for an Outlook data file, which is either a Personal Folders File (.pst) or an Offline Folder File (.ost). Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_. `IsDataFileStore`

_expression_ A variable that represents a [Store](Outlook.Store.md) object.


## Remarks

 **IsDataFileStore** supports only Exchange stores, and will return **False** for HTTP-type stores such as Hotmail and MSN, and for IMAP stores.

For Exchange stores,  **IsDataFileStore** will return **False** if the user profile is not using Cached Exchange mode. **IsDataFileStore** will also return **False** when the store is an Exchange Public Folder (that is, **[Store.ExchangeStoreType](Outlook.Store.ExchangeStoreType.md)** is **olExchangePublicFolder**).

 **IsDataFileStore** does not indicate whether the store is located on a local hard drive. For example, a .pst file could be located on a mapped network drive and **IsDataFileStore** would still return **True**.

The return value of  **IsDataFileStore** can change if the user is configured for classic Exchange offline mode. When the user is offline and using classic Exchange offline mode, **IsDataFileStore** will return **True**. When the user is online and using classic Exchange online mode, **IsDataFileStore** will return **False**.
