# IVisEventProc.VisEventProc Method (Visio)

Private member function of  **IVisEventProc** that handles event notifications passed to it by the **EventList.AddAdvise** method.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `VisEventProc`( `_nEventCode_` , `_pSourceObj_` , `_nEventID_` , `_nEventSeqNum_` , `_pSubjectObj_` , `_vMoreInfo_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents an 'IVisEventProc' object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _nEventCode_|Required| **Integer**|The event or events that occurred. |
| _pSourceObj_|Required| **Object**|The object whose  **EventList** collection contains the **Event** object that sent the notification.|
| _nEventID_|Required| **Long**|The unique identifier of the  **Event** object within the **EventList** collection.|
| _nEventSeqNum_|Required| **Long**|The ordinal position of the event with respect to the sequence of events that have occurred in the calling instance of the application. |
| _pSubjectObj_|Required| **Object**|The subject of the event, which is the object to which the event occurred. See Remarks for examples.|
| _vMoreInfo_|Required| **Variant**|Additional information about the subject of the event. See Remarks for more information.|

## Return value

Variant


## Remarks

To handle event notifications, create a class module that implements the  **IVisEventProc** interface and then create an instance of this class to pass as an argument to the **AddAdvise** method of the **EventList** collection. Use the **AddAdvise** method to create **Event** objects that send the notifications.

The  _nEventCode_ parameter identifes the specific event or events that occurred. The _EventCode_ argument of the **AddAdvise** method is passed to **VisEventProc** as _nEventCode_. Within your procedure, you can use any branching technique you want to determine which event occurred and handle it. The example that accompanies this topic uses a  **Select Case** decision structure.

Unlike the  **Index** property of the **EventList** collection, _nEventID_ does not change as **Event** objects are added or deleted from the collection.

From within  **VisEventProc** , you can use the following code to get the **Event** object that sent the notification:




```vb
pSourceObj. EventList.ItemFromID(nEventID )
```

The connection between the source object  _pSourceObj_ and the **Event** object exists until one of the following occurs:


- The program deletes the  **Event** object.
    
- The program releases the last reference to the source object. (The  **EventList** collection and **Event** objects hold a reference to their source object.)
    
- The Microsoft Visio application instance terminates.
    
The first event that occurs in a Visio instance has  _nEventSeqNum_ = 1, the second event = 2, and so on. In some cases, you can use the sequence number in conjunction with the **EventInfo** property to obtain more information about the event.

The _pSubjectObj_ parameter for a **ShapeAdded** event is a **Shape** object that represents the shape that was just added, while the subject of a **BeforeSelectionDelete** event is a **Selection** object in which the shapes that are about to be deleted are selected.

For many events,  _vMoreInfo_ is a string similar to the command line the application passes to the add-ons it executes. If the notification does not include additional information, this parameter is set to **Nothing**. For details about notification parameters for a particular event, see the particular event topic in this Automation Reference.

 Beginning with Visio 2000, **VisEventProc** is defined as a function that returns a value. However, Visio only looks at return values from calls to **VisEventProc** that are passed a query event code. Sink objects that provide **VisEventProc** through **IDispatch** require no change. To modify existing event handlers so that they can handle query events, change the **Sub** procedure to a **Function** procedure and return the appropriate value. (For details about query events, see this reference for event topics prefixed with **Query**.)

If  _nEventCode_ identifies a query event (events prefixed with **Query**), return **True** from **VisEventProc** to cancel the event, and return **False** to allow it to happen. The value is arbitrary for other events. If you do not return an explicit value, Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) returns an empty **Variant** , which Visio interprets as **False**.


## Example

This example shows how to create a class module that implements  **IVisEventProc** to handle events fired by a source object in Visio, for example, the **Document** object. The module consists of the function **VisEventProc** , which uses a **Select Case** block to check for three events: **DocumentSaved** , **PageAdded** , and **ShapesDeleted**. Other events fall under the default case (**Case Else**). Each **Case** block constructs a string ( _strMessage_) that contains the name and event code of the event that fired. Finally, the function displays the string in the Immediate window.

Copy this sample code into a new class module in VBA or Visual Basic, naming the module  **clsEventSink**. You can then use an event-sink module to create an instance of the **clsEventSink** class and **Event** objects that send notifications of event firings to the class instance. To see how to create an event-sink module, see the example for the **AddAdvise** method.




```vb
 
Implements Visio.IVisEventProc 
 
 
'Declare visEvtAdd as a 2-byte value 
'to avoid a run-time overflow error 
Private Const visEvtAdd% = &H8000 
 
Private Function IVisEventProc_VisEventProc( _ 
 ByVal nEventCode As Integer, _ 
 ByVal pSourceObj As Object, _ 
 ByVal nEventID As Long, _ 
 ByVal nEventSeqNum As Long, _ 
 ByVal pSubjectObj As Object, _ 
 ByVal vMoreInfo As Variant) As Variant 
 
 Dim strMessage As String 
 
 
 'Find out which event fired 
 Select Case nEventCode 
 Case visEvtCodeDocSave 
 strMessage = "DocumentSaved (" & nEventCode & ")" 
 Case (visEvtPage + visEvtAdd) 
 strMessage = "PageAdded (" & nEventCode & ")" 
 Case visEvtCodeShapeDelete 
 strMessage = "ShapesDeleted(" & nEventCode & ")" 
 Case Else 
 strMessage = "Other (" & nEventCode & ")" 
 End Select 
 
 
 'Display the event name and the event code 
 Debug.Print strMessage 
 
End Function
```
