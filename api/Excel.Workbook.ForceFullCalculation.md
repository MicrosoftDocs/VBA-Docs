# Workbook.ForceFullCalculation property (Excel)

Returns or sets the specified workbook to forced calculation mode. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_. `ForceFullCalculation`

 _expression_ An expression that returns a '[Workbook](Excel.Workbook.md)' object.


## Return value

Boolean


## Remarks

If the workbook is in the forced calculation mode, dependencies are ignored and all worksheets are marked to calculate fully every time a calculation is triggered. This setting remains in effect until Excel is restarted.

Setting the  **ForceFullCalculation** property to **True** will increase the calculation times for data tables in proportion to the size of the data table. Given an NxM data table, the calculation time will increase by about _base time_ x ( _N_ x _M_ ), so that a 3x4 data table may take about 12 times as long to calculate if this property is set to **True**.


## Example

The following example sets the active workbook to forced calculation mode.


```vb
ActiveWorkbook.ForceFullCalculation = True
```
