# Application.PresentationBeforeSave event (PowerPoint)

Occurs before a presentation is saved.


## Syntax

_expression_. `PresentationBeforeSave`( `_Pres_`, `_Cancel_` )

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[Application](PowerPoint.Application.md)** object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Pres_|Required|**Presentation**|The presentation being saved.|
| _Cancel_|Required|**Boolean**|**True** to cancel the save process.|

## Remarks

This event is triggered as the  **Save As** dialog box appears.

To access the  **Application** events, declare an **Application** variable in the General Declarations section of your code. Then set the variable equal to the **Application** object for which you want to access events. For information about using events with the Microsoft PowerPoint **Application** object, see [How to: Use Events with the Application Object](../powerpoint/How-to/use-events-with-the-application-object.md).


## Example

This example checks if there are revisions in a presentation, and if there are, asks whether to save the presentation. If a user's response is no, the save process is canceled. This example assumes an **Application** object called PPTApp has been declared by using the **WithEvents** keyword.


```vb
Private Sub PPTApp_PresentationBeforeSave(ByVal Pres As Presentation, _
        Cancel As Boolean)

    Dim intResponse As Integer

    Set Pres = ActivePresentation

    If Pres.HasRevisionInfo Then

        intResponse = MsgBox(Prompt:="The presentation contains revisions. " & _
            "Do you want to accept the revisions before saving?", Buttons:=vbYesNo)

        If intResponse = vbYes Then

            Cancel = True

            MsgBox "Your presentation was not saved."

        End If

    End If

End Sub
```
