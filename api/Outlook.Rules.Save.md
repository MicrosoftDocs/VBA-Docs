# Rules.Save Method (Outlook)

Saves all rules in the  **[Rules](Outlook.Rules.md)** collection.


## Syntax

 _expression_. `Save`( `_ShowProgress_` )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a [Rules](./Outlook.Rules.md) object.


### Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _ShowProgress_|Optional| **Boolean**| **True** to display the progress dialog box, **False** to save rules without showing the progress.|

## Remarks

After you enable a rule, you must also save the rule by using  **Rules.Save** so that the rule and its enabled state will persist beyond the current session. A rule is only enabled after it has been saved successfully.

 **Rules.Save** can be an expensive operation in terms of performance on slow connections to Exchange server. For more information on using the progress dialog box, see [Manage Rules in the Outlook Object Model](../outlook/How-to/Rules/managing-rules-in-the-outlook-object-model.md).

Saving rules that are incompatible or have improperly defined actions or conditions (such as an empty string for  **[TextRuleCondition.Text](Outlook.TextRuleCondition.Text.md)**) will return an error.

The Exchange server limits the maximum number of rules that can be supported by a store.  **Rules.Save** returns an error when this limit is reached.
