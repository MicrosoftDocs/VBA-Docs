You can set the **Format** property to predefined date and time formats or use custom formats for the Date/Time data type.

## Settings

### Predefined formats

The following table shows the predefined **Format** property settings for the Date/Time data type.

|Setting|Description|
|:------|:----------|
|General Date|(Default) If the value is a date only, no time is displayed; if the value is a time only, no date is displayed. This setting is a combination of the Short Date and Long Time settings.<br/><br/>Examples: 4/3/93, 05:34:00 PM, and 4/3/93 05:34:00 PM.|
|Long Date|Same as the Long Date setting in the regional settings of Windows.<br/><br/>Example: Saturday, April 3, 1993.|

Dates between 1/1/30 and 12/31/99 are assumed to be twentieth century dates (that is, the years are assumed to be 1930 to 1999).|

## Example

The following are examples of custom date/time formats.

|Setting|Display|
|:-----|:-----|
|`ddd", "mmm d", "yyyy`|Mon, Jun 2, 1997|
|`mmmm dd", "yyyy`|June 02, 1997|
|`"This is week number "ww`|This is week number 22|
|`"Today is "dddd`|Today is Tuesday|

You could use a custom format to display "A.D." before or "B.C." after a year depending on whether a positive or negative number is entered. To see this custom format work, create a new table field, set its data type to Number, and enter a format as follows:

`"A.D. " #;# " B.C."`

Positive numbers are displayed as years with an "A.D." before the year. Negative numbers are displayed as years with a "B.C." after the year.
