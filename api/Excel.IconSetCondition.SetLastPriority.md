# IconSetCondition.SetLastPriority method (Excel)

Sets the evaluation order for this conditional formatting rule so it is evaluated after all other rules on the worksheet.


## Syntax

_expression_. `SetLastPriority`

_expression_ A variable that represents an [IconSetCondition](Excel.IconSetCondition.md) object.


## Remarks

The actual value of the priority will be equal to the total number of conditional formatting rules on the worksheet. When you have multiple conditional formatting rules in a worksheet, this method will cause the priority of rules that had a priority value greater than this rule to be decreased by one.


 **Note**  Priority levels for conditional formatting rules are applied on a worksheet-level basis.
