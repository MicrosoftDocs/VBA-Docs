# SharedWorkspaceTask.Priority property (Office)

Gets or sets the status of the specified shared workspace task. Read/write.

> [!NOTE] 
> Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Syntax

_expression_. `Priority`

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a '[SharedWorkspaceTask](Office.SharedWorkspaceTask.md)' object.


## Remarks

The shared workspace task schema on the server can be customized. Customization of the schema may affect the task priority enumeration when the  **Add** or **Save** method is called. **Priority** property values are mapped as follows:




- Downloaded value 1 is mapped to  **msoSharedWorkspaceTaskPriority** 1 (**msoSharedWorkspaceTaskPriorityHigh**). Downloaded values 2 through N-1 are mapped to **msoSharedWorkspaceTaskPriority** 2 (**msoSharedWorkspaceTaskPriorityNormal**). Downloaded value N is mapped to **msoSharedWorkspaceTaskPriority** 3 (**msoSharedWorkspaceTaskPriorityLow**).
    
- Uploaded enumeration values 1 through 3 are mapped to schema values 1 through 3. If a user-specified value does not map to any value defined in the schema, the user-specified value is silently ignored and the  **Status** property is not updated on the server.
