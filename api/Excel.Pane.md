# Pane Object (Excel)

Represents a pane of a window.


## Remarks

 **Pane** objects exist only for worksheets and Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro sheets. The **Pane** object is a member of the **[Panes](Excel.Panes.md)** collection. The **Panes** collection contains all of the panes shown in a single window.


## Example

Use  **[Panes](Excel.Window.Panes.md)** ( _index_ ), where _index_ is the pane index number, to return a single **Pane** object. The following example splits the window in which worksheet one is displayed and then scrolls through the pane in the lower-left corner until row five is at the top of the pane.


```vb
Worksheets(1).Activate 
ActiveWindow.Split = True 
ActiveWindow.Panes(3).ScrollRow = 5
```
