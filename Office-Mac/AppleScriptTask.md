# Run an AppleScript with VB
 
Call an AppleScript file from a VB macro in Office 2016 for Mac.

**Applies to**: Excel for Mac | PowerPoint for Mac | Word for Mac | Office 2016 for Mac

The **AppleScriptTask** command executes an AppleScript script file located outside the sandboxed app. 

The following code shows how to call **AppleScriptTask** from VB.

```vb
    Dim myScriptResult as String
    myScriptResult = AppleScriptTask ("MyAppleScriptFile.applescript", "myapplescripthandler", "my parameter string") 
```

The MyAppleScript.applescript file must be in ~/Library/Application Scripts/[bundle id]/. The .applescript extension is not required; you can also use the .scpt extension.

`Myapplescripthandler` is the name of a script handler in the `MyAppleScript.applescript` file.

`My parameter string` is the single input parameter to the `myapplescripthandler` script handler.

The following are the [bundle id] values for Excel, PowerPoint, and Word:

- com.microsoft.Word
- com.microsoft.Excel
- com.microsoft.Powerpoint

For example, the corresponding AppleScript for Excel would be in a file named `MyAppleScriptFile.applescript` that is in ~/Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.Excel/.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The folders such as `com.microsoft.Excel` may not exist. In that case, just create them by using a standard **mk dir** command. 

The following is an example of a handler.

```vb
    on myapplescripthandler(paramString) 

    #do something with paramString 
    return "You told me " & paramString 

    end myapplescripthandler
```

## What happened to MacScript?

Earlier versions of Office for Mac implemented a command called **MacScript** that supported inline AppleScripts. Although that command still exists in Office 2016 for Mac, **MacScript** is deprecated. Due to sandbox restrictions, the **MacScript** command cannot invoke other applications, such as Finder, in Office 2016 for Mac. We recommend that you use the **AppleScriptTask** command instead of the **MacScript** command in apps for Office 2016 for Mac.
