# Change the Macro Settings for Visio

1. Click the **File** tab, and then click **Options**
    
2. Click **Trust Center**.
    
3. Click **Trust Center Settings**, and then click **Macro Settings**. 
    
4. Set the options you want, and then click **OK**.
    
Because macros can contain viruses, be careful about running them. Take the following precautions: run up-to-date antivirus software on your computer; on the **Add-ins** tab, check the **Require Application Add-ins to be signed by Trusted Publisher** box; use digital signatures; and maintain a list of trusted publishers.
