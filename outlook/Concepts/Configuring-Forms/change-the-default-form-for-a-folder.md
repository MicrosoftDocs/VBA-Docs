# Change the Default Form for a Folder

You can change the default form for a particular public folder so that when a new item is created, it will use a custom form. This procedure requires Owner permissions on a public folder.


1.  If the Folder List is not visible, click the **Folder List** button at the bottom of the **Navigation Pane**. 
    
2. Right-click the public folder for which you want to specify the default form, and then click **Properties**. 
    
3. In the **When posting to this folder, use** box, click the form that you want others to use.
    

 **Note**  To copy, install, delete, and update forms in this folder, click **Manage** on the **Forms** tab. You can also specify available forms in a public folder by selecting an option under the **Allow these forms in this folder** box.
