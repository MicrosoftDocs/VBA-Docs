# Create a Custom Action for a Form Region

You can specify custom actions for a form region. By default, four built-in actions exist for any form region. To create an action that suit your needs, you can either modify a built-in action or create a new custom action. For more information on modifying a built-in action, see [How to: Modify a Built-in Action for a Form Region](modify-a-built-in-action-for-a-form-region.md).

When you create a custom action, you can specify the following characteristics in the form region manifest XML file that you register for the form region:

- The display name for the custom action.
    
- Whether the custom action will be displayed on the ribbon of an inspector.
    
- The way that the resulting item will be addressed.
    
- The message class of the item that results from executing the action.
    
- The way that the body of the current item is included in the resulting item.
    
- The way that Outlook responds when executing the action.
    
- The prefix value in the subject of the resulting item.
    
For more information on registering a form region, see [Specifying Form Regions in the Windows Registry](specifying-form-regions-in-the-windows-registry.md).

## Identifying Actions for a Form Region

Whether you choose to modify a built-in action or create a custom action, you define the action in the form region manifest XML file. Define these actions under the **customActions** element, enclosing each action in its own **action** element and identifying it by the mandatory **name** attribute. The value of the **name** attribute is a string that represents the internal name of the action.


### To specify an internal name for an action

1. In the form region manifest XML file, specify the action as a child **action** element of the **customActions** element for that form region.
    
2. Specify the internal name of the action as the value of the **name** attribute of the **action** element.
    
The following example assigns `replyToBlog` as the internal name of one custom action, and `postToBlog` as the internal name of another custom action:

```vb
<customActions>
    <action name="replyToBlog">
        <!-- further characterize this action -->
    </action>
    <action name="postToBlog">
        <!-- further characterize this action -->
    </action>
</customActions>
```


## Defining a Custom Action

After you have identified an action in an **action** element, you can further define the action by specifying optional child elements for the **action** element.


### To define a display name for the action

1. In the form region manifest XML file, specify the action as a child **action** element of the **customActions** element for that form region.
    
2. Specify the internal name of the action as the value of the **name** attribute of the **action** element.
    
3. Specify the display name of the action as the value of the child **title** element of the **action** element.
    
The following example assigns `replyToBlog` as the internal name of a custom action, and `Reply to Blog` as the display name of the action:

```vb
<customActions>
    <action name="replyToBlog">
        <title>Reply to Blog</title>
        <!-- Further characterize this action -->
    </action>
</customActions>
```

### To specify that an action is to be displayed on the ribbon of an inspector

1. In the form region manifest XML file, specify the action as a child **action** element of the **customActions** element for that form region.
    
2. Specify the internal name of the action as the value of the **name** attribute of the **action** element.
    
3. Specify **True** as the value of the child **showOnRibbon** element of the **action** element.
    
The following example assigns `replyToBlog` as the internal name of a custom action and specifies that it should not be displayed in the ribbon of an inspector:

```vb
<customActions>
    <action name="replyToBlog">
        <showOnRibbon>false</showOnRibbon>
        <!-- Further characterize this action -->
    </action>
</customActions>
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can assign **showOnRibbon** either a string value or an integer value. Specifying **True** or **1** will display the action on the ribbon; specifying **False** or **0** will prevent it from being displayed on the ribbon.

### To specify the way that a resulting item will be addressed

1. In the form region manifest XML file, specify the action as a child **action** element of the **customActions** element for that form region.

2. Specify the internal name of the action as the value of the **name** attribute of the **action** element.

3. Specify a value for the child **addressLike** element of the **action** element.

The following example assigns `replyToBlog` as the internal name of a custom action and specifies that the resulting new item will be addressed as a reply-all item, with all the original recipients copied over to the new item:

```vb
<customActions>
    <action name="replyToBlog">
        <addressLike>replyAll</addressLike>
        <!-- Further characterize this action -->
    </action>
</customActions>

```

> [!NOTE]
> The child **addressLike** element of the **action** element can contain one of the following values:

|Value|Description|
|----|----|
| **forward**|Addresses the resulting item like a forward message that has no recipients specified. This also preserves attachments in the current item.|
| **reply**|Addresses the resulting item as a standard reply, with the sender specified in the **To** line, and no one in the **CC** or **BCC** lines.|
| **replyAll**|Addresses the resulting item like a reply-all message, with all of the original recipients copied over to the resulting item.|
| **replyToFolder**|Addresses the resulting item like a post message to the current folder. This also clears the subject of the resulting item.|
| **response**|Addresses the resulting item as a response to vote, with the sender specified in the **To** line, and no one in the **CC** or **BCC** lines.|
