# Testing and Publishing Your Forms

After you design and complete your form, test it to make sure that it works the way that you designed it to work. 

> [!NOTE] 
> You cannot test form regions from inside Microsoft Outlook. You must save the form as an .ofs file, update the add-ins that are used with the form regions, and then restart Outlook. For more information, see [How to: Create a Form Region](create-a-form-region.md).

To test, at run time, an Outlook form that has customized form pages, publish the form to a folder or your Personal Forms Library, and then open it to see how it works. Send the form to yourself to check the Reply actions, and then publish the form to a public folder or to your Organization Forms Library for others to use. You can also save a form to use in email or as a template.
