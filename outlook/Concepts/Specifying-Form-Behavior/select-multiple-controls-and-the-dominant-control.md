# Select Multiple Controls and the Dominant Control

You can select more than one control in three ways. When you select multiple controls, one of the controls becomes a reference for the rest and is called the dominant control.



|**Selection method**|**Controls selected**|**Dominant control**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **SHIFT+CLICK**|All controls in an invisible rectangle around the selected controls.|The first control that you select.|
| **CTRL+CLICK**|Individual controls, one at a time.|The last control that you select.|
| **Select Objects** pointer in **Control Toolbox**|All controls that fall within or touch a rectangle that you draw.|The control that is nearest to the mouse pointer when you begin to draw the rectangle.|
