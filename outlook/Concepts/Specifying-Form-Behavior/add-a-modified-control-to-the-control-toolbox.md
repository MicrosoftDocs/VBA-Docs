# Add a Modified Control to the Control Toolbox

1. In an open form on the **Developer** tab, in the **Tools** group, click
![Control Toolbox icon](../../../images/0548_ZA06045100.gif) **Control Toolbox**.
    
    **Note** If you do not see the **Developer** tab in the open form, see the topic [Run in Developer Mode in Outlook](../../How-to/Using-Visual-Basic-to-Customize-Outlook-Forms/run-in-developer-mode-in-outlook.md).
2. Drag a control from the **Control Toolbox** to your form and customize it. For example, to create an **OK** button, drag a **CommandButton** control onto the form, set its **Caption** property to **OK**, and set its **Default** property to **True**. 
    
3. Select the customized control. 
    
4. Drag the control to the **Control Toolbox**.
    

 **Note** When you drag a control onto the **Control Toolbox**, you only transfer the advanced property values. Any lines of code or Outlook property values that you have written for that control do not transfer with the control. You must write new code or copy code from the control on the form to the control on the **Control Toolbox**.
