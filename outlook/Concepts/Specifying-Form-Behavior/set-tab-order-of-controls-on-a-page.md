# Set Tab Order of Controls on a Page

1. In the Forms Designer, right-click a page, but not a control, and then click **Tab Order**. 
    
2. Select the name of the control that you want to reposition in the tab order. 
    
3. Click **Move Up** or **Move Down**.
    

 **Note** You can also set the tab order by changing the  [TabIndex](../../../api/Outlook.tabstrip.taborientation.md) property. The tab index of the first control in the tab order is **0**; the tab index of the second control is **1**, and so on.
