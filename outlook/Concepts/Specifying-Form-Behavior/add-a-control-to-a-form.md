# Add a Control to a Form

Use this procedure to add a control from the  [Control Toolbox](../Customizing-Forms/control-toolbox-overview.md) to your form. You can also use this procedure to insert a control in a **[Frame](../../../api/Outlook.frame.md)**, **[TabStrip](../../../api/Outlook.tabstrip.md)**, or **[MultiPage](../../../api/Outlook.multipage.md)** on the form.


1. In an open form on the **Developer** tab, in the **Tools** group, click **Control Toolbox**.
    
    **Note** f you do not see the **Developer** tab in the open form, see the topic [Run in Developer Mode in Outlook](../../How-to/Using-Visual-Basic-to-Customize-Outlook-Forms/run-in-developer-mode-in-outlook.md).
2. Do one of the following:
    
      - Click a control in the **Control Toolbox** and then click in the form. The control appears in its default size. You can then drag the border of the control to change its size.
    
  - Drag a control from the **Control Toolbox** to the form. The control appears in its default size.
    
  - Double-click the control in the **Control Toolbox**, and then click in the form once for each control that you want to create. For example, to create four command buttons, double-click the  [CommandButton](../../../api/Outlook.commandbutton.md) control in the **Control Toolbox**, and then click four times in the form.
