# Specify Whether a Form Prompts the User, Opens, or is Sent

 **Note** If you are setting properties for a form that is customized with form regions, you must use the XML manifest file instead of the Form Designer. To learn more, see  [How to: Create a Form Region](../Outlook-Forms/create-a-form-region.md).


## Forms customized with form pages


1. In the Form Designer, click the **(Actions)** page of your form.
    
2. Click the action that you want, and then click **Properties**. 
    
3. Under **This action will**, click the option that you want the form to perform.
    


|**Click this option**|**To**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **Open the form**|Open the form so that the user can add information.|
| **Send the form immediately**|Send the form to the specified address without opening it.|
| **Prompt the user to open or send**|Alert the user with a message that includes the option to open or send the form.|

 **Note** If you click **Send the form immediately**, you must  [pre-address](../Configuring-Forms/pre-address-a-reply-form-to-a-public-folder-or-an-e-mail-address.md) the form.
