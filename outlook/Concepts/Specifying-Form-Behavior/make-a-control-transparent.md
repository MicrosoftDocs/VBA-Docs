# Make a Control Transparent

1. Right-click the control that you want to make transparent, then click **Advanced Properties**. 
    
    **Note** In this context, "transparent" means that the control inherits the background color of the parent control.
2. Set the **BackStyle** property to **Transparent**. To set the property, click the **BackStyle** property, and then click **Transparent** in the **Apply** list. If the control supports the **BorderStyle** property, set it to **None**. 
    

 **Note** When you make a control transparent, the background color does not appear, so the **BackColor** property is ignored. However, the setting for **BackColor** is not changed when a control is transparent.
