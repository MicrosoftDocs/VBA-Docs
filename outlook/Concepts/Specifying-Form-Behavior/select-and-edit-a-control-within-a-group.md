# Select and Edit a Control Within a Group

1. Select the group of controls. 
    
2. Select a single control within the group. The sizing handles around the group become lighter, and dark sizing handles appear on the selected control. 
    
3. Make the changes that you want to the selected control properties. Any change you make affects only the selected control. 
    
4. When you are finished, click anywhere in the group, but do not click the selected control. The group is still selected. 
    
5. Select another control in the group, or continue to another task.
