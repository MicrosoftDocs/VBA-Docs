# Adding Items to a List

You can add items to a list box or a combo box at design time or at run time. 

To save contents in an item, **[ListBox](../../../api/Outlook.listbox.md)** and **[ComboBox](../../../api/Outlook.combobox.md)** controls must be bound to a field.

For more information, see the following topics:
