# Using Multiple Accounts for the Same Profile on Outlook

You can sign in to Outlook by using a profile that specifies one or more accounts associated with different delivery stores. For a given session, the **NameSpace** object has members that maintain and access information for the primary Exchange account, and the [Accounts](../../../api/Outlook.NameSpace.Accounts.md) property of the [NameSpace](../../../api/Outlook.NameSpace.md) object holds information for all the accounts defined for the session's profile. 

The **NameSpace.Accounts** property returns an [Accounts](../../../api/Outlook.Accounts.md) collection for the current profile, tracking information for all accounts including Exchange, IMAP, and POP3 accounts, each of which can be associated with a different delivery store. To identify the primary Exchange account in the **Accounts** collection for a session, look for the account that has the [ExchangeStoreType](../../../api/Outlook.Store.ExchangeStoreType.md) property of the store (that is specified by **[Account.DeliveryStore](../../../api/Outlook.Account.DeliveryStore.md)**) equal to **OlExchangeStoreType.olPrimaryExchangeMailbox**.

```vb
Account.DeliveryStore.ExchangeStoreType = OlExchangeStoreType.olPrimaryExchangeMailbox
```

The following table compares members of the **NameSpace** object and members of the [Account](../../../api/Outlook.Account.md), **Accounts**, or [Store](../../../api/Outlook.Store.md) object depending on whether the session's profile has one account or multiple accounts. If only the primary Exchange account is in the session's profile, use the following members of the NameSpace object.
