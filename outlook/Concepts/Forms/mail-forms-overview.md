# Mail Forms Overview

You can customize all pages of an email form in Microsoft Outlook by using form pages.

You can also use form regions to remove and add pages for customization. 

Like post forms, mail forms have separate **Compose** and **Read** pages. When a user opens a new email message, the form is displayed in **Compose** mode, and pages are displayed so that the user can fill out the form to be sent. When the recipient opens the item, the form is displayed in **Read** mode, and a different set of pages and controls can be used to display the data in the fields. When designing an email message form, you can choose to disable the separate **Read** and **Compose** pages so that the form is identical at all times. If you use separate pages, you can often copy and paste the controls from the one set of pages to the other.

If you are customizing a mail form for use in an organization that is using Microsoft Exchange Server, the form should be published in the Organizational Forms Library. 

 **Note** 

When you design a mail form, it is important to consider which type of message format the form should be in. The choices are Microsoft Rich Text, HTML, and plain text. You should give careful consideration to what versions of Outlook that potential recipients will be using.

 **Note** Some of the properties and objects related to mail formats might behave differently depending on whether Outlook 98, Outlook 2000, or Outlook 2003 is running in **Corporate Workgroup** mode or **Internet Mail Only** mode. Outlook 2002, Outlook 2007 and later do not distinguish between the **Corporate Workgroup** mode and **Internet Mail Only** mode.
