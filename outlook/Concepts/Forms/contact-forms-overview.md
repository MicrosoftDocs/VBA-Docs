# Contact Forms overview

Although you can hide any of the default pages and create new pages on a Contact Form, the **General** page is the only page that you can modify. To customize the page, add an adjoining form region or use form regions to replace existing form pages. For more information, see [Form Regions](../Outlook-Forms/form-regions.md).

> [!NOTE] 
> On the **General** page, you cannot modify the **Address**,  **Phone**, and  **Email** "selector" lists that contain the names of standard Outlook fields. In addition, the **FileAs** list offers a limited number of choices that are based on the information that you provide, and those choices cannot be modified. To create a **FileAs** list with more options, use a form region.
