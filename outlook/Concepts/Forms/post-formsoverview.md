# Post Forms Overview

Similar to mail forms, all post form pages are customizable, and have separate **ompose** and **Read** pages that you can modify. (You can also use form regions to remove and add pages for customization.)

A folder that contains posts is usually grouped by the **onversation** field to keep related topics together. The **Conversation** field, also known as the **ConversationTopic**property in the Microsoft Outlook object model, is set based on the  **bject** field of a new post in the folder. All replies to this item inherit the **Conversation** field from the parent item. However, if the user changes the **Subject** field, the **Conversation** field is set to the new subject, which creates a new conversation.
