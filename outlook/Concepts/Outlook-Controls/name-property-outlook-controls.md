# Name Property (Outlook Controls)

Returns or sets a **String** that identifies the control. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Name**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an Outlook control object.


## Remarks

Guidelines for assigning a string to **Name**, such as the maximum length of the name, vary from one application to another.

For objects, the default value of **Name** consists of the object's class name followed by an integer. For example, the default name for the first **[OlkTextBox](../../../api/Outlook.OlkTextBox.md)** you place on a form is OlkTextBox1. The default name for the second **OlkTextBox** is OlkTextBox2.

You can set the **Name** property for a control from the control's property sheet or, for controls added at run time, by using program statements. If you add a control at design time, you cannot modify its **Name** property at run time.

Each control added to a form at design time must have a unique name.
