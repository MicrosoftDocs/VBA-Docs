# ZOrder Method (Outlook Controls)

Places the object at the front or back of the z-order.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ZOrder**(**_zPosition_**)

 _expression_ A variable that represents an Outlook control object.


## Parameters



|Name|Required/Optional|Data type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|zPosition|Optional| **Variant**|A control's position, front or back, in the container's z-order.|

## Remarks

The settings for  _zPosition_ are:



|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|0|Places the control at the front of the z-order. The control appears on top of other controls (default).|
|1|Places the control at the back of the z-order. The control appears underneath other controls.|

The z-order determines how windows and controls are stacked when they are presented to the user. Items at the back of the z-order are overlaid by closer items; items at the front of the z-order appear to be on top of items at the back. When the  _zPosition_ argument is omitted, the object is brought to the front.

In design mode, the **Bring to Front** or **Send To Back** commands set the z-order. **Bring to Front** is equivalent to using the **ZOrder** method and putting the object at the front of the z-order. **Send To Back** is equivalent to using **ZOrder** and putting the object at the back of the z-order.

You can't Undo or Redo layering commands, such as **Send To Back** or **Bring to Front**. For example, if you select an object and click **Move Backward** on the shortcut menu, you won't be able to Undo or Redo that action.
