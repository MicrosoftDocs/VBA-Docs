# ControlTipText Property (Outlook Controls)

Returns or sets a **String** that appears when the user briefly holds the mouse pointer over a control without clicking. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ControlTipText**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an Outlook control object.


## Remarks

The **ControlTipText** property lets you give users tips about a control in a running form. The property can be set during design time but only appears by the control during runtime.

The default value of **ControlTipText** is an empty string. When the value of **ControlTipText** is set to an empty string, no tip is available for that control.

Note that for the **[OlkBusinessCardControl](../../../api/Outlook.OlkBusinessCardControl.md)** and **[OlkContactPhoto](../../../api/Outlook.OlkContactPhoto.md)** controls, **ControlTipText** is not displayed when mousing over the control.
