# Visible Property (Outlook Controls)

Returns or sets a **olean** that specifies whether a control is visible or hidden. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Visible**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an Outlook control object.


## Remarks

 **True** if the control is visible (default); **False** if the control is hidden.

Use the **sible** property to control access to information without displaying it. For example, you could use the value of a control on a hidden form as the criteria for a query.

All controls are visible at design time.
