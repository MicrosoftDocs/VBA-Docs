# Test a Form in Run Time




## Forms customized with form regions

You cannot test forms that you customize with form regions from inside Outlook. Instead, you must save the form as an .ofs file, update the add-ins that are used with the form regions, and then restart Outlook. For more information, see  [How to: Create a Form Region](../Outlook-Forms/create-a-form-region.md).


## Forms customized with form pages


1. To switch the form between design mode and run mode (that is, the way the form appears when it is used) do the following. In the Forms Designer, on the **eveloper** tab, in the **Form** group, click **Run This Form**.
    
    **ote** You can test the form outside the Microsoft Outlook design environment by opening a new instance of the form. 
2. Type information in the form, send or post it, and then open the form to make sure that it behaves as expected.
