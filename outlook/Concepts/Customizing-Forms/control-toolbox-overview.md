# Control Toolbox Overview

The  [Control Toolbox](../Specifying-Form-Behavior/show-or-hide-the-control-toolbox.md) identifies the controls that you can add to a **Frame** or a page of a form.

You can customize the **ontrol Toolbox** in many ways including the following:

- Add pages to the **ontrol Toolbox**. 
    
- Move controls from one page in the **ontrol Toolbox** to another.
    
- Rename **ontrol Toolbox** pages.
    
- Add other controls, including ActiveX controls, to the **ontrol Toolbox**. 
    
- Copy modified controls from the form to the **ontrol Toolbox**. For example,  **** and **Cancel** buttons are special types of [CommandButtons](../../../api/Outlook.commandbutton.md). If you copy * *** and **Cancel** templates to the **Control Toolbox**, you can quickly add them to other forms.
    

 **Note** hen you add a control to a form by using the **ontrol Toolbox**, the control is not bound to a field.
