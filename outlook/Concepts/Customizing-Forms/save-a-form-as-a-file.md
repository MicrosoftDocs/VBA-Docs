# Save a Form as a File

## Forms customized with form regions

When you save a form that is customized with form regions, you must save each form region layout as an Outlook Form Storage (.OFS) file. Additional steps include creating an XML manifest for each form region and registering them in the Windows registry, specifying the message class that each form region is intended for. For more information about saving form regions. see  [How to: Create a Form Region](../Outlook-Forms/create-a-form-region.md).
