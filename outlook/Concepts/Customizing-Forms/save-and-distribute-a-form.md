# Save and Distribute a Form

There are two ways in Microsoft Outlook to save a form that has customized form pages. (If you customize a form with form regions, the procedure to save the form region and make the form available is also different.)

> [!NOTE] 
> Outlook custom forms cannot be directly converted into other types of forms, such as Microsoft Exchange Web forms for Microsoft Outlook Web Access or Microsoft Office InfoPath forms.


## Forms customized with form regions

To save the layout of the form region, click **Form Region**, and then click **orm Region** to save the form region layout file with an .ofs extension. After that, you must create a form region manifest XML file and register the form region in the Windows registry.

## Forms customized with form pages


- Save the form in a forms library when you want to save a form to a location for easy access. There are three forms libraries. To open the libraries in an open form, on the **per** tab, in the **Form** group, click **Choose Form**. The libraries are listed in the       **x.
    
  - **Personal Forms Library**. Forms saved in this library are accessible only to you and are stored in your mailbox. Use this library when you create a form for your own personal use, such as a form to track mileage.
    
  - **Outlook Folders**. Forms saved in this library can be accessible to everyone (in a public folder) or only to you (in a private folder). If the form is saved in a library on your hard disk, it is accessible to you only while you are working in the folder. These forms are available on the item menu while you are in the folder. Use this library when saving forms to a specific folder, generally a public folder. For example, in a customer-tracking public folder, you could have a meeting report form and a customer profile form.
    
  - **Organizational Forms Library**. Forms saved in this library are accessible to everyone in your organization and are stored on the server. You must have write permission to save to the server. For more information, see your administrator. Use this library when you want to make the form available to everyone in your organization, such as a form to report vacation time. Saving to this library provides a quick and easy way to distribute and update forms.
    
- Save the form as a file. Use this option when you want to work with the form in another program or you want to save the form as a template, and you do not plan to share the form with others, or you want to send the form to others by using email.
