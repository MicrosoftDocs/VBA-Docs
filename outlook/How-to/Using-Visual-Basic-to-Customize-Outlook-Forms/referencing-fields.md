# Referencing Fields

When you need to access the fields in an item, the method you use depends on whether the field is a standard built-in Outlook field, or a custom field.

In either case, you do not access the field directly. Instead, you refer to the field as a property of the item you are working with.

For example, to retrieve the text from the Subject field of a mail message, you use the **Subject** property of the item, as shown in the following VBScript example.




```vb
mySubject = Item.Subject
```

If the field is a custom (user-defined) field, you access it using the **UserProperties** property of the item, as shown in the following VBScript example. This example assumes that the item already contains a custom field named ReferredBy.



```vb
MyReferral = Item.UserProperties("ReferredBy")
```
