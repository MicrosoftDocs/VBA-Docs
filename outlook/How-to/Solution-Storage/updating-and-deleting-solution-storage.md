# Updating and Deleting Solution Storage

This topic describes updating and deleting solution storage.


## Updating Solution Storage

You can store private solution data as an attachment or as the value of a property of a **[StorageItem](../../../api/Outlook.StorageItem.md)** object in most folders. Since it is possible for multiple solutions to share the same solution storage, after updating an attachment or property, a solution should call ** [StorageItem.Save](../../../api/Outlook.StorageItem.Save.md)** to update the item in the folder. In cases where there is more than one solution accessing the same object, the object would always show the updates through the most recent **StorageItem.Save**.

Attempting to save to a **StorageItem** object that has been deleted will result in the error, "Unable to perform the operation."


## Deleting Solution Storage

Solutions can remove a **StorageItem** object by calling ** [StorageItem.Delete](../../../api/Outlook.StorageItem.Delete.md)**. This call permanently removes the object from the folder; it does not move it to the **Deleted Items** folder. This allows a solution to clean up or reset the storage for its private data.

Attempting to delete a **StorageItem** that has been removed by a prior **StorageItem.Delete** call will result in the error, "Could not complete the deletion."


 **Note** Solution storage can only be removed through the **Delete** method of the corresponding **StorageItem** object. If the creator solution has been uninstalled and there is no other solution that can access the object to delete it, the object will remain as a hidden item in the folder for as long as the folder exists.
