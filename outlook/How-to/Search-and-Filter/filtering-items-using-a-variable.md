# Filtering Items Using a Variable

You can use values from variables as part of a filter in Microsoft Jet syntax or DAV Searching and Locating (DASL) syntax. The following example illustrates the use of variables as part of a filter: 


```vb
fullname = "Dan Wilson" 
' This approach uses Chr(34) to delimit the value.  
criteria = "[FullName] = " & Chr(34) & fullname _ & Chr(34) 
' This approach uses the double quotation mark to delimit the value.  
criteria = "[FullName] = """ & fullname & """" 
' This approach uses the escaped hexadecimal value of the double quotation mark to delimit the value.  
criteria = "[FullName] = "%22" & fullname & "%22"" 

```
