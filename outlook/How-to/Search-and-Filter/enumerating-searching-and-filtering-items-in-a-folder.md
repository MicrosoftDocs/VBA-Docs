# Enumerating, Searching, and Filtering Items in a Folder

The Outlook object model provides several entry points that support enumerating, searching, and filtering items in a folder. 

## Enumerating Items

The **[Items](../../../api/Outlook.Items.md)**, **[Table](../../../api/Outlook.Table.md)**, and **[Selection](../../../api/Outlook.Selection.md)** objects all support enumerating items in a folder. However, there are specific scenarios where you would choose one over the others.

You can obtain an **Items** collection by calling **[Folder.Items](../../../api/Outlook.Folder.Items.md)** which returns the items in the folder. Each item object in the collection is complete with all its explicit built-in properties and custom properties, and supports read-write operations. The **Items** collection also supports filters and events that fire when items are added, changed, or removed from the collection.

You can use **[Folder.GetTable](../../../api/Outlook.Folder.GetTable.md)** or **[Search.GetTable](../../../api/Outlook.Search.GetTable.md)** to obtain a **Table** object that represents a set of items in a folder or search folder. In both cases, you can specify a filter to obtain a subset of the items in the folder, or, if you do not specify any filter, obtain all the items in the folder. By default, each item in the returned **Table** contains only a default subset of its properties. 

You can view each row of a **Table** as an item in the folder, each column as a property of the item, and the **Table** is an in-memory light-weight rowset that allows fast enumeration and filtering of items in the folder. Although additions and deletions of the underlying folder are reflected by the rows in the **Table**, the **Table** does not support any events for adding, changing, and removing rows. 

If you require a writeable object from the **Table** row, obtain the Entry ID for that row from the default EntryID column in the **Table** and then use the **[GetItemFromID](../../../api/Outlook.NameSpace.GetItemFromID.md)** method of the **[NameSpace](../../../api/Outlook.NameSpace.md)** object to obtain a full item, such as a **[MailItem](../../../api/Outlook.MailItem.md)** or **[ContactItem](../../../api/Outlook.ContactItem.md)**, that supports read-write operations. For more information on default columns in a **Table**, see  [Default Properties Displayed in a Table Object](default-properties-displayed-in-a-table-object.md).

The **Selection** object supports enumerating items that a user has currently selected in an explorer. Since the explorer displays the contents of a folder, the **Selection** object supports enumeration of items in that folder as per the user's selection.

 **Note** A folder in Outlook can contain heterogeneous items. For example, the Contacts folder supports creating contact items and distribution list items by default. Since the **Items**, **Table**, and **Selection** objects encapsulate items in a folder or search folder, the items in them do not necessarily have the same message class. When enumerating items in these collections and objects, it is a good practice to first check for the message class of each item before accessing the item's properties.


## Searching and Filtering Items

The **Items**, **Table**, **[Application](../../../api/Outlook.Application.md)**, and **[View](../../../api/Outlook.View.md)** objects support searching and filtering of items in a folder. The following table describes and compares these entry points:


| **Entry Point**| **Action**| **Object of Search Filter**| **Jet Filter Support**| **DASL Filter Support**| **Comments**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **[Application.AdvancedSearch](../../../api/Outlook.Application.AdvancedSearch.md)**|Sets the criteria for a **Search** object and returns the **Search** object. **[Search.Results](../../../api/Outlook.Search.Results.md)** specifies the search results. **[Search.Save](../../../api/Outlook.Search.Save.md)** updates a search folder with the search results.|Folder|No|Yes||
| **Folder.GetTable**|Returns a **Table** of items in a folder based on any given filter.|Folder|Yes|Yes|Certain properties are not supported in the **Table** filter, including binary properties, and HTML or RTF body content. For more information, see [Unsupported Properties in a Table Object or Table Filter](unsupported-properties-in-a-table-object-or-table-filter.md).|
| **[Items.Find](../../../api/Outlook.Items.Find.md)**|Searches for first item that satisfies the specified filter. |Folder|Yes|No|Certain properties are not supported in the filter, including **Body**. For more information, see **Items.Find**.|
| **[Items.Restrict](../../../api/Outlook.Items.Restrict.md)**|Filters given set of items based on specified restrictions and returns another **Items** collection.|Folder|Yes|Yes|Certain properties are not supported in the filter, for example, **Body**. For more information, see **Items.Restrict**.|
| **Search.GetTable**|Returns a **Table** of items in a search folder based on any filter derived from **Application.AdvancedSearch**.|Search folder|No|Yes| **Search.GetTable** derives its filter from the **Search** object (specifically the **[Search.Filter](../../../api/Outlook.Search.Filter.md)** property) returned from **Application.AdvancedSearch**.|
| **[Table.Restrict](../../../api/Outlook.Table.Restrict.md)**|Filters rows in the given table based on a specified filter and returns another **Table** object.|Folder|Yes|Yes|Certain properties are not supported in the **Table** filter, including binary properties, and HTML or RTF body content. For more information, see [Unsupported Properties in a Table Object or Table Filter](unsupported-properties-in-a-table-object-or-table-filter.md).|
| **[View.Filter](../../../api/Outlook.View.Filter.md)**|Sets a view's filter without changing the view's XML. Setting the filter for a view only changes the view in the user interface and does not result in a filtered **Items** collection.|Folder|No|Yes||
| **[View.XML](../../../api/Outlook.View.XML.md)**|Gets or sets the XML for a view. Modifying the <Filter> node changes the view's filter. Setting the XML for a view only changes the view in the user interface and does not result in a filtered **Items** collection.|Folder|No|Yes|View XML is being deprecated. Use the View object model to program views.|
