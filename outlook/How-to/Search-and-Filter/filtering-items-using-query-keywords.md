# Filtering Items Using Query Keywords

You can use the following query keywords only in DAV Searching and Locating (DASL) queries. Keywords are case-insensitive. Microsoft Jet does not support any query keywords.

## ci_startwith and ci_phrasematch
    
These content indexer keywords provide prefix and phrase matching respectively for items in an indexed store. For example, the following DASL query creates a filter for last name starting with "Smith" and uses a content indexer keyword to return the results:
    
```vb
  criteria = "@SQL=" & Chr(34) _ 
& "urn:schemas:contacts:sn" & Chr(34) _ 
& " ci_startswith 'Smith'"
```

The following DASL query creates a filter for last name being exactly "Smith" and uses a content indexer keyword to return the results: 

```vb
  criteria = "@SQL=" & Chr(34) _ 
& "urn:schemas:contacts:sn" & Chr(34) _ 
& " ci_phrasematch 'Smith'"
```

## Is Null
    
Evaluates if a property is null. Returns True if the property is null and False if the property is not null.
    
**Is Null** operations are useful to determine if a date property has been set or if a string property is empty. If the date is null, the local time value of the date will be equal to 1/1/4501.
    
The syntax of **Is Null** is as follows, where _PropertyName_ is the name of a property referenced by namespace:

```sql
 [PropertyName] IS NULL
```

You can combine the **Is Null** keywords with the **Not** operator to evaluate if a property is not null.
    
The following DASL query retrieves all contacts where the custom property **Order Date** is not null and the **[CompanyName](../../../api/Outlook.ContactItem.CompanyName.md)** property is exactly Microsoft:
    
```vb
  criteria = "@SQL=" & "(NOT(" _ 
& Chr(34) & "https://schemas.microsoft.com/mapi/string/" _ 
& "{00020329-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}/Order%20Date" & Chr(34) _ 
& " IS NULL) AND " _ & Chr(34) & "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office#Company" 
& Chr(34) _ & " = 'Microsoft')"
```
