# Obtain a Folder Object from a Folder Path

This topic shows a function that accepts a folder path and returns a **[Folder](../../../api/Outlook.Folder.md)** object that corresponds to the specified folder. For example, if you provide the folder path "Mailbox - Dan Wilson\Inbox\Customers", the code in the `TestGetFolder` procedure will display the **Folder** object that corresponds to the Customers folder under Dan Wilson's Inbox, if the Customers folder exists under the Inbox. If the Customers folder does not exist, `GetFolder` will return `Nothing`.


```vb
Function GetFolder(ByVal FolderPath As String) As Outlook.Folder 
    Dim TestFolder As Outlook.Folder 
    Dim FoldersArray As Variant 
    Dim i As Integer 
 
    On Error GoTo GetFolder_Error 
    If Left(FolderPath, 2) = "\\" Then 
        FolderPath = Right(FolderPath, Len(FolderPath) - 2) 
    End If 
    
    'Convert folderpath to array 
    FoldersArray = Split(FolderPath, "\") 
    Set TestFolder = Application.Session.Folders.item(FoldersArray(0)) 
    If Not TestFolder Is Nothing Then 
        For i = 1 To UBound(FoldersArray, 1) 
            Dim SubFolders As Outlook.Folders 
            Set SubFolders = TestFolder.Folders 
            Set TestFolder = SubFolders.item(FoldersArray(i)) 
            If TestFolder Is Nothing Then 
                Set GetFolder = Nothing 
            End If 
        Next 
    End If 
     
   'Return the TestFolder 
    Set GetFolder = TestFolder 
    Exit Function 
 
GetFolder_Error: 
    Set GetFolder = Nothing 
    Exit Function 
End Function 
 
Sub TestGetFolder() 
    Dim folder As Outlook.Folder 
    Set folder = GetFolder ("\\Mailbox - Dan Wilson\Inbox\Customers") 
    If Not(folder Is Nothing) Then 
        folder.Display 
    End If 
End Sub
```
