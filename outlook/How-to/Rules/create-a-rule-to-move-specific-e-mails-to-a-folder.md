# Create a Rule to Move Specific Emails to a Folder

This topic shows a code sample in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that uses the **Rules** object model to create a rule. The code sample uses the **[RuleAction](../../../api/Outlook.RuleAction.md)** and **[RuleCondition](../../../api/Outlook.RuleCondition.md)** objects to specify a rule that moves messages from a specific sender to a specific folder, unless the message contains certain terms in the subject. Note that the code sample assumes that there already exists a folder named "Dan" under the Inbox.

The following describes the steps used to create the rule:

1. Specify the target folder  `oMoveTarget` to move specific messages as determined by the condition and exception condition. The target folder is a subfolder named "Dan" under the Inbox, and is assumed to already exist.
    
2. Use **[Store.GetRules](../../../api/Outlook.Store.GetRules.md)** to obtain a set of all the rules in the current session.
    
3. Using the **[Rules](../../../api/Outlook.Rules.md)** collection returned from the last step, use **[Rules.Create](../../../api/Outlook.Rules.Create.md)** to add a new rule. The new rule specifies some action upon receiving a message, so it is of type **olRuleReceive**.
    
4. Using the **[Rule](../../../api/Outlook.Rule.md)** object returned from the last step, use the **[RuleConditions.From](../../../api/Outlook.RuleConditions.From.md)** property to obtain a **[ToOrFromRuleCondition](../../../api/Outlook.ToOrFromRuleCondition.md)** object, `oFromCondition`.  `oFromCondition` specifies the condition for the rule: when a message is from `Dan Wilson`. 
    
5. Using the same **Rule** object, use the **[RuleActions.MoveToFolder](../../../api/Outlook.RuleActions.MoveToFolder.md)** property to obtain a **[MoveOrCopyRuleAction](../../../api/Outlook.MoveOrCopyRuleAction.md)** object, `oMoveRuleAction`.  `oMoveRuleAction` specifies the action for the rule: move the message to the target folder "Dan".
    
6. Using the same **Rule** object, use the **[RuleConditions.Subject](../../../api/Outlook.RuleConditions.Subject.md)** property to obtain a **[TextRuleCondition](../../../api/Outlook.TextRuleCondition.md)** object, `oExceptSubject`.  `oExceptSubject` specifies the exception condition: if the subject contains the terms "fun" or "chat", then do not apply the rule to move the message to the folder "Dan".
    
7. Use **[Rules.Save](../../../api/Outlook.Rules.Save.md)** to save the new rule together with the rest of the rules for the current store.

    Set colRules = Application.Session.DefaultStore.GetRules() 
     
    'Create the rule by adding a Receive Rule to Rules collection 
    Set oRule = colRules.Create("Dan's rule", olRuleReceive) 
 
    'Specify the condition in a ToOrFromRuleCondition object 
    'Condition is if the message is from "Dan Wilson"

    With oMoveRuleAction 
        .Enabled = True 
        .Folder = oMoveTarget 
    End With 
 
    'Specify the exception condition for the subject in a TextRuleCondition object 
    'Exception condition is if the subject contains "fun" or "chat" 
    Set oExceptSubject = _ 
        oRule.Exceptions.Subject 
    With oExceptSubject 
        .Enabled = True 
        .Text = Array("fun", "chat") 
    End With 
 
    'Update the server and display progress dialog 
    colRules.Save 
End Sub
