# Extend the Use of an Outlook Item by Adding Fields and Pages

In this approach, you take a standard Microsoft Outlook item, such as a contact, message, task request, or meeting request, and add fields and extra pages. (You can also extend the use of an Outlook item with form regions. For more information, see  [Form Regions](../../Concepts/Outlook-Forms/form-regions.md).)


 **Note** You must base all custom forms on existing Outlook forms. If you do not want to use the default form functionality that Outlook provides, you can hide all the default form pages and use only the extra blank pages to create a complete custom form. In addition, you can extend the functionality of a customized form by using form regions.


## Customizing with form pages


1. Open the item on which you want to base the form. For example, if you want your form to organize and collect information about a person or organization, open a contact. 
    
2. In the item, on the **Developer** tab, in the **Form** group, click **Design This Form** to open the item in design mode.
    
    **Note** If you do not see the **Developer** tab in the open contact, see the topic [Run in Developer Mode in Outlook](../Using-Visual-Basic-to-Customize-Outlook-Forms/run-in-developer-mode-in-outlook.md).
3. Set attributes for the form. In design mode, you add attributes such as a caption, password, or description on the **Properties** page. The **Actions** page lists default Reply forms. You can add your own custom Reply forms to the **Actions** page, and you can change several aspects of how the default Reply forms work.
    
4. Design the form by moving, removing, and adding fields and pages in the form. All the fields in the form and all the fields you add from the **Field Chooser** retain their built-in properties and functionality.
    
5.  [Test and publish](../../Concepts/Outlook-Forms/testing-and-publishing-your-forms.md) your form. You can see how your form looks right away; open your new form in run mode by clicking **Run This Form** in the **Form** group on the form. You can publish your form to your Personal Forms Library or to a folder to test it, and then publish the form to a public folder or to the Organization Forms Library so that others can use it.
