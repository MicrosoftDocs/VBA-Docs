# Identify a Meeting Item as a Counter-Proposal to a Prior Meeting Request

This topic shows how to use the named property,  [PidLidAppointmentCounterProposal](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f510af2d-92b3-4c98-bdf4-8aca8e8b80d1%28Office.15%29.aspx), and the Microsoft Outlook object model to identify a  **[MeetingItem](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/guid_b75730f5-b395-3d66-5acd-b64fd8fcd78f.aspx)** object as a counter proposal to a prior meeting request.

In the Outlook object model, all types of items, such as a mail item and a contact item, correspond to specific message classes. In particular, responses to a meeting request can be identified by the following message classes: 

- IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Neg for a decline response
    
- IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Pos for an acceptance response
    
- IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Ten for a tentative response
    

However, the Outlook object model does not provide a means to identify a response as the fourth possible response to a meeting request, which is a counter-proposal.
Using the  **[PropertyAccessor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/guid_2fc91e13-703c-3ec9-9066-ffee7144306c.aspx)** object and the **PSETID_Appointment** namespace definition of **PidLidAppointmentCounterProposal**, you can program within the object model to distinguish all responses of a meeting request item. The following code sample in C# shows how to get the property value given a meeting item. Note that in the code sample, the named property is expressed as: 



```vb
"http://schemas.microsoft.com/mapi/id/00062002-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}/8257000B"
```

where  `{00062002-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}` is the **PSETID_Appointment** namespace and `8257000B` is the property tag of **PidLidAppointmentCounterProposal**.



```C#
private bool IsCounterProposal(Outlook.MeetingItem meeting) 
{ 
    const string counterPropose = 
        "http://schemas.microsoft.com/mapi/id/{00062002-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}/8257000B"; 
    Outlook.PropertyAccessor pa = meeting.PropertyAccessor; 
    if ((bool)pa.GetProperty(counterPropose)) 
        return true; 
    else 
        return false;  
}
```
