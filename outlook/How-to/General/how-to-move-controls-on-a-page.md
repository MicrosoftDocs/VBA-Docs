# Move Controls on a Page

The following example demonstrates moving all the controls on a form by using the **Move** method with the Microsoft Forms 2.0 **Controls** collection. The user clicks on the **[CommandButton](../../../api/Outlook.commandbutton.md)** to move the controls.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Script Editor of a form. Make sure that the form contains a **CommandButton** named CommandButton1 and several other controls.



```vb
Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 Set Controls = Item.GetInspector.ModifiedFormPages("P.2").Controls 
 'Move each control on the form right 25 points and up 25 points. 
 Controls.Move 25, -25 
End Sub
```
