# Reference a Custom Property that Has the Same Name as a Built-in Property of the Control

Assume a new control has a **Top** property that is different from the standard **Top** property in Microsoft Forms. You can use either property, based on the syntax:

This example uses the standard **Top** property:

```vb
  control.Top
```

This example uses the **Top** property from the added control:    

```vb
  control.Object.Top
```
