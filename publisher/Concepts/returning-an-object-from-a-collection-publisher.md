# Returning an Object from a Collection (Publisher)

The  **Item** method returns a single object from a collection. The following example sets a variable to a **[Page](../../api/Publisher.Page.md)** object that represents the first page in the **[Pages](../../api/Publisher.Pages.md)** collection.


```vb
Sub SetFirstPage() 
 Dim pgFirst As Page 
 Set pgFirst = ActiveDocument.Pages.Item(1) 
End Sub
```


The  **Item** method is the default method for most collections, so you can write the same statement more concisely by omitting the **Item** keyword.




```vb
Sub SetFirstPage() 
 Dim pgFirst As Page 
 Set pgFirst = ActiveDocument.Pages(1) 
End Sub
```
